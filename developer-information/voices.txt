691 - rodics diary thir drag tober yet again its rigning just i wanted to go for a wal to drain a village with my gorgeous new walking stick and maybe pop infity with a wise old man how typical ohwell i'm sure i can find some way to pass the time maybe i'll leave through some of those old books that belong to my late uncle he had such strange interests sarah dome in rest is cell
692 - twentieth penber i'm becoming seriously concerned about sotle pot he's completely smashed the pillars of my celler fortunately i was able to shore up the ceeding with some bits of wood before the whole seller caved in perhaps i should have taken up carp and t instead of raising a drankken
693 - for ack tuper i believe i found a marvelous new hobby one of those old books was a manual for rearing pet dragons i don't have a garden but i'm sure i can do just as well keeping it in my cellar there's penty of space down there and it'll be out of the rain i've written to the taavily petshop to order an egg in some supplies
694 - n reack to at last i'm feeling well enough to resume my diary furthermore my delivery has arrived fast soon er than i had hoped that postman is a curious little chp but he certainly knows his trade not to unpack the egg and get started eleventh rack tber that apparently it takes ages for these eggs to hatch out disappointing i think i shall name it sotle thought if it's a boy dragon and pity pins if it's a girl dragon
695 - i've agreed to act as an advisor for the adventurer since they are unfamiliar with this country still now all that excitement is over i should try to find myself a new hobby
696 - fifteenth tentember i must admit that i'm starting to have second thoughts about this little project of buy sotre pot has grown so large that i'm not entirely sure he'll fiture the trap door of the sellar anymore furthermore no matter how much i feed him he keeps well sallevating when he looks at me he was a lot sweeter when he was smaller i wonder if parent is like this
697 - fifth racuubber no sign of my ap yet and it s still raining never mind i shall braave the rain and take a war after all six r tubber dear i has such a terrible cold
698 - twenty first pentember that bled to drack and almost managed to break the change that were holding into the wall if he gets loose there's no way i'm going to be able to restrain him again at the risk of looking like a complete ninkandpoop i think i'am going to have to call someone to sort him out before i lose control if in completely the white night might be able to help
699 - post scripthim saved at last the white night sent an agent in response to my message he couldn't have arrived at a better time i'd completely lost control of the dragon and it had me cornered in a coupvered in my own seller with the aid of a passing adventurer he managed to kill the dragon and then we tunneled out of the sellar into jack house because the blasted dragon had bent my ladatter
700 - fourteen thack tber little subtle pot has hatched these dragons really are marvelous creatures thirty second drack tubber i've had no time for this diary recently i seem to find myself constantly busy preparing minstced meat and bring him water he's growing so fast

8797 - no i've never seen anyone is dedicated to their life as sister anna
8798 - welcome back adventure
8799 - you should also question the sisters around the abbey but please do so suuckilyi don't want them to know there has been a murder
8800 - no a confrontation would lead to more bloodshed there must be a better way
8801 - it looks like sister anna was right their sister eleanor was still alive i suppose i would have to expel her as it is the other sisters don't need to know
8802 - if you're right she must be hiding somewhere nearby we need a way to find her
8803 - i cannot offer you much of a reward adventurer but please accept a set of the orders' robes they are enchanted wearing them will allow you to meditate on music in order to grow clo ser saradomen
8804 - every death was a tragedy but we should also take this as a confirmation of our faith zamarak would only send an assin demon against someone of exceptional holiness
8805 - what
8806 - you're doing a good job but i have a feeling that some information you haven't found yet
8807 - i suppose it's possible i want to be absolutely sure before we move though
8808 - i last source as to hanor advper yesterday when she wasn't present a complin i went to herself and found her body the murder must have taken place between those times
8809 - you're doing a good job but i have a feeling you're still missing something
8810 - very well i suppose it's good that your thor i was here in my office you might be surprised how much paperwork is involved in running a religious order
8811 - the sisters are rehearsing sister anna's funeral the last thing we need is a secular musician tempting them away from their duties
8812 - and yet i prayed for an adventure at to come and you came saradomen works through us in ways we do not realize
8813 - thank you for telling the truth adventurer but this will shake the faith of everyone in the abbey
8814 - i've never seen anyone as devoted to saradomman a sister anna was all the other sisters looked up to her
8815 - her name was isabella she was here for a few days sister anna and i both interviewed hershe wasn't allowed to mix much with the other sisters
8816 - i doubt it i don't think you could have conducted a thorough investigation in this short time
8817 - did you hear that
8818 - a few months ago sister anna brought me astack of letters she'd found in sister elean's room she was furious
8819 - in the basement during the funeral service all the systemisters will be in the oratory it will be the perfect time for the killarter strike
8820 - the killer is going to strike again unless we catch them
8821 - enough we don't need to go through the sordid details we've established a connection but how does it help us
8822 - sister anna wanted to pel as ter eleanor but i decided to give her a second chance she appeared contrite as long as she stopped seeing valallario i said she could stay in the abbey
8823 - thank you adventurer i'll have the passage blocked immediately
8824 - please adventurer investigate sister elean's murder then talk to me in my study
8825 - one of our sisters has been murdered murdered quite brutally
8826 - it's clear that we don't know who the keiller is what should we do
8827 - all the sisters of my order of suspects that two of you are the only people i've seen in the same place as the killer so you are the only people i can trust
8828 - this is the key to sister annacell where i found her body the cells are in the southeast corner of the abbey
8829 - sister deah told me what you did but she didn't say who the killer was she said you should be the one to tell us
8830 - in case you hadn't noticed from this building state of repair the order is not exactly rolling a material wealth
8831 - it is possible that she killed sister anna but i don't see how her wounds could have been self-inflicted
8832 - what was that sound adventure
8833 - she never mentioned you to me all she would say was that her past life was sinful and she wanted to put it behind her
8834 - the sisters are rehearsing sister annaas funeral the last thing we need is a secular musician tempting them away from their duties
8835 - i don't know much about her life before the abbey all she told me was that she'd led a highly immoral life and she was glad she'd put it behind her
8836 - it seems we have a plan valario and i can handle the announcement adventurer you will need to make the dummy in the basement once you're ready you can hide in the road cabinet and wait
8837 - adventurer there 'sno point in might trying to keep this from the sters anymore i 'lllet them know what 's happening
8838 - but my most trusted friend could do this and i had no idea
8839 - then saradomen was truly with you adventurer
8840 - i moved sister anna's body to the infiry in the southwest of the abbey i cleaned and wrapped it myself and i forbidden the other sisters from seeing
8841 - a secret passage that could be how the killer got away after murdering sister eleanor
8842 - whom do you suspect
8843 - this notebook will help you keep track of your investigation
8844 - your reluctance to jump to conclusions is admirable adventurer i wouldn't want to accuse someone before we are absolutely sure
8845 - then we will need to catch the killer without knowing who they are what can we do
8846 - do you suspect
8847 - i would like you to investigate the killer may still be in the abbey
8848 - i appreciate yourselflessness adventurer but if the killer were interested in you they would have struck by now
8849 - sister catarina is outside dancing i don't want to pass judgment on her not now but i think she'd be safer inside could you go and fetch up please
8850 - the holy citre no i don't think that would work the killer hit in the basement when they merurdered sister leinor that they didn't touch the relicquy
8851 - i wouldn't say we argued we disagreed about sudden theological issues we had many invigorating discussions that i suppose an evevesdropper could mistake for arguments
8852 - then we must pray for saradjome to be with us
8853 - i've called you here for a sensitive task one that i would prefer to deal with quietly without involving the church authorities or the aleried guard i hope i can trust you to be discrete
8854 - oh great sarah joman sister eena
8855 - is that is a joke it is in very poor taste not all of us treat death s flippantly as adventurers
8856 - we are struggling but not with anything dramatic after the news of what happened got out it's not surprising that we've had fewer applicants
8857 - i know about your involvement with sister eleanor and perhaps the killer could have seen ster at arena dancing and thought that but what about sister anna she hadn't left the abbey for years
8858 - adventurer thanks saradom you've come
8859 - what 's happening here
8860 - come back to me when you've examine the crime scene and the body and spoken to the sister
8861 - she was my assistant she would have been my successor when i eventually retired and she was also my friend please adventurer bring her killer to justice
8862 - quick follow the sound of that scream
8863 - adventurer you need to make the dummy in the basement once you're ready you can hide in a row cabinet and weight
8864 - very well i suppose it is good that your thora i was here in my office you might be surprised how much paperwork is involved in running a religious order
8865 - none of us is sstaint elbeth but if saradomen is with us we will prevail how do you propose to fight adventurer
8866 - that could tempt the killer out but who i don't think the killer is indiscriminate what did the victims so far having common
8867 - in any case i don't think the killer is motivated by worldly possessions
8868 - whether this killer be demon or mortal i swear they will not kill again saradom and go with all of us
8869 - thank saraddomin its' overretenturer
8870 - oh merciful sarahjomman sister catara is
8871 - hopefully things will return to normal in time is not well there's nothing you can do
8872 - it's not unusual for a woman to decide this life isn't for her we don't pass judgment if someone doesn't say goodgoodbye
8873 - you'are welcome to use our cryptorium to make your own illuminated copies of the book of saradomen use your book on the bookmaking stand to start
8874 - sister anna was the first victim he had better have a good theory about how that makes sense
8875 - if you're right she must affected her own death and gone into hiding we need a way to find her
8876 - you not suspect ing me you
8877 - the order would end and the abbey would become a dead shell the sisters would be too frightened to go back there must be another way
8878 - i don't know what he's doinghere i haven'tallowed him into the aby
8879 - i doubt it i don't think you can have conducted a thorough investigation in this shorter time
8880 - i can't remain as abass knowing that this evil could sproutge in soil that i have tended i ll look for a replacement but i don't know how much longer the water will survive
8881 - it's not for anymany of our robes it looks like it's from some travellling clothes
8882 - we were all there right after sister catarena was murdered we each know the others are innocent that's why it is the three of us having this discussion
8883 - i will not let this defeat us we must arrive at a plan adventurer after all you've seen whom do you now suspect
8884 - adventure if i can ask where are you asking these questions
8885 - it's all right i'm just a novice i haven't taken v i'm not not allowed
8886 - helho again adventure how can i help
8887 - i'm quite well i know i shouldn't be but i'm quite proud of it perhaps you'd like to see it after the funeral servicesit if you 're still here
8888 - who don t to do something like go how could ar de let this happen
8889 - she was so holly she thought about saradom all the time never about herself i don't know iffore ever be as whoholy is that
8890 - anyway i think i might leave the order i haven't decided yet
8891 - what i mean a bit that we're not meantred to question the abtst's decisions
8892 - i was in the criictorium copy a manuscript
8893 - system and you 've got to find whoever did this adventurer if there 's anything i can do anything just let me know

8898 - oh well it's for saraaddoen it doesn't matter if anyoneelsees it

8954 - about it was catarina novices have to be taught discipline i've seen a sneaking an extra cop of wine at meal times she's the one you should be talking into
8955 - sister anna thought sister aneita was too lenient with the orddererss rules anna would have in forced silence outside of services she have stopped sister cecilia composing prescribed melodies only

8963 - maybe it's sarad or's will that sister an and never got to be come maus i don 't know it 's not my place to say
8964 - what is it
8965 - actually and notghticeis something when i was down there i think someone's been stealing food from the sellar
8966 - she's with saradome win know it doesn't matter what i thought ofher and it was no good to speak ill of the dead
8967 - jo't touch anything please
8968 - oh i 'm sorry she's dead and well i can think of us how much the ir needed her i 'm too single minded sometimes
8969 - look at me look at me
8970 - and wasa just like in the stories it was wrapped in rags and it how ' shch grows and
8971 - she fought the demon and it mortally wounded her but as she was dying saradom granted her the strength to singing one piercing note so perfect that it struck the demon dead
8972 - i didn't know they say some demons can return after being killed that the god wars worth thousands of years ago
8973 - it 's a ce elspeth i root the music about the words are traditional
8974 - she had a powerful voice and a rock sodden since a rhythm the home calrigation could listento to keep in time
8975 - i saw it abis it was a dmon was sria
8976 - i'm glad i left the abbey this so much more i can do with music now that i can focus on it for its own sake
8977 - well i'd like to think so but i don't think where as holy as in he speth i hope we never have to find out
8978 - and always wonder what life might have been like if i'd st there
8979 - zamara sent the ripper to attack a village where saint elzabeth was staying it couldn't approach while she was singing but it waited on the edge of the village
8980 - all right latest the avice told what happened this funeral service will be for je of us now
8981 - since you are here adventurer could i ask for your advice
8982 - it was edging overforstill it was cutting her feet with its cokbooks why wouldn't do that
8983 - i'll always wonder what life might have been like if i'd left there
8984 - saint elspeth was a holy warrior who lived during the god w she sang and played the citrer and her music was so holy that no de bear to hear it
8985 - it pushed pasting it's st ter as name put on my roes and then it run up the stairs way
8986 - i could leave and become a secular musician cravel of the world
8987 - but on the other hand i do feel the presence of saradomen here and if i leave i can never come back
8988 - i think she kept us in time in moreways than one though she was our morign center an example of holiness we all miss her terribly
8989 - ok that 's good remember to look at me so you can keep in time
8990 - thank you adventure
8991 - then it saw me it turns its head it looked at me i couldn't see its face her doomit if i've seen it i think i might have died a fright
8992 - whatdo you think i should do venture
8993 - the murders in the abbey made me think about what i want to do with my life but i've been here since i was a child and i thought i'd spend my whole life here but now i'm not sure i want to
8994 - i'm aware he 's there i think the abice was right to forbid him from coming inside
8995 - the ripper was an assin demon it would strike without warning and leave its victims horribly mutilated stab them through the heart with terrible clause tear off their faces
8996 - i'm glad i stayed in the abbey wanting to leave was just a face there's so much i can do here to praise saradomen i think i might even be called to be abisofter sister bene a retireres
8997 - oh it 's an ancient string instrument it's like an liar the liear was a fo instrument whereas the c was a professional instrument th every way that 's not important
8998 - you 've got to protect us the demon is back
8999 - of course i suppose i'll stay here and think about it
9000 - she sang for days that eventually was too weak to go on she went out of the village to face the demon alone she thought it might just kill her and spare the villages
9001 - look at me looks me
9002 - thank you for helping us adventure i really thought i was going to die but you saved us
9003 - you've got to understand this coried order considers music to be wholly it should be used for worship and contemplation not for dancing dancing is so often connected with other immortality
9004 - oh i'm sorry i didn' ladies a keep hing while i talkked to this pilgrim
9005 - we're going to sing a funeral service worthy of our friends and even a demon isn't going to stop us
9006 - her remains lay unburied until the present age then seventy years ago a group of holy woman's andthem and built this abbey in her memory that's why music is such an important part of our worship
9007 - okay from the top look at me
9008 - wi to trust saradomin and we 're not going to be afraid we 're going to sit light sa elsmith and the demon isn 't going to be able to us

9056 - i'm afraid so
9057 - it's a song about someone i knew a long time ago

9069 - sister catarina is that you
9070 - what can i do for you
9071 - youre the adventurer you solved the mystery and defeated the killer it was better that she should hear it from you
9072 - but it seems that wasn't sarajman's plan so he's taken her away the clock runs just not as we'd expected
9073 - it's no good catarina i can't hear you i'll be out of here in a minute just need to get the
9074 - no need to touch the clock again ad venturer we wouldn't want to be going off at the wrong time

9076 - and then so good don't
9077 - i was a clock breaker before i joined the abbey now i'm the only one who knows how to repair the apy clock
9078 - would you do merea favor catarina the clock is twenty minutes farast right now could you set it to the right time
9079 - hello again adventurea
9080 - sister anita was planning to retire as abas next year everyone expected sister anna to become the new abs
9081 - i'm fine the clock is running smoothly
9082 - as a good sara dominis sister i cannot take a life
9083 - sister catarina talk to me before you touch that please
9084 - well between wasn'and what
9085 - ah yes that's it i you said the cloup to the hour so any moment now it should
9086 - oh i came back up here tried to finish this set of repairs
9087 - as seeyou downstairs adventure
9088 - a part breaks that you 'd expected to hold for years but that doesn't stop the whole mechanism it just sets it in a different direction sarah doom is a better lookckmaer than us
9089 - i think that you were a mechanic and it was your decision how best to fix the clock
9090 - i'm just shaken i don't normally get that much excitement
9091 - i'm too busy with the clock to worry about visitors it's not like i could hear his music anyway i don't know if you'd noticed but i'm a big death it's spending all my time close to the battle when it goes off that did that
9092 - course sister eleanor may sv doilman's justice find whoever did this adventurea
9093 - perhaps sarahjunman gave me strength
9094 - oh yes this ter casatarna mentioned something about that she seemed very excited
9095 - ah no that's wrong the sorry should have reminded you remember you're seeing the clock from the inside so it's back to frt from your point of view try again
9096 - oh i'm terribly sorry i thought you were s ter catarina she's normally the one who comes up here what can i do for you
9097 - please help us adventurea but if you are destined to fail may sarad doomman help me accept my fate
9098 - as a good seven domin sister i cannot take a life
9099 - right i'm down
9100 - what i'm getting that is perhaps it's better for someone who have the wrong time if that's what keeps their clock going it's better than setting the clock right but having it stop
9101 - she kuress the applicant and dressed her in her roobbes
9110 - yeah

17957 - return women are fce attend the farrow i have business here
17958 - hi i must go
17959 - in some ways i've been after his heart sincein theday i was born
17960 - crazy you dare call me crrazy i and beautiful her powerful
17961 - did you get the heart my lady
17962 - osmand was suspicious of me from the start no surprise there but he was so distracted with the kidnapping i had free reain of the past
17963 - yes my lady i live to serve and serve to live
17964 - the payment was also delyied
17965 - a tiny dose of poison in the emmy nightly inense did the trke and they believe his death to be of natural causes
17966 - none anymore or my lady my mission was a success
17967 - ah so i see
17968 - and if i'm reading it right you can only perform two ways to figure out which is the heavy weight the triick that's got to be in the scroll toool
17969 - no ozan lost the diamond
17970 - into the lion's mouth yes i remember it
17971 - oh what was it again
17972 - yeah that might have been the wrong wayight
17973 - but you must know my orders me i cannot allow you to leave with a diamond handedit over
17974 - that to clarify that's first and experience with the diamond
17975 - let's just say that jo banishment was a llineient sentence whoever steals the diamonddss best not return to al carite ad
17976 - we came ststrink war you to passen the ransom note
17977 - and you did not want to do this right now
17978 - because i understand how you think ozanne and i did not want you to attempt another theft
17979 - i had to put all the weight back to reset it
17980 - i remember i was never here this conversation did not happen
17981 - yes lila gave us who passphlaase
17982 - shthink we can always bakin a good magh
17983 - forgets that second path for a moment i don't know what that used to what i do know is that the path of the sun is somehow linked to the carriage inbut
17984 - wait shaharis ardi that was it
17985 - okay let's for a moment say i believe you why didndidt le i'm not return with you
17986 - now i shall rock this fault and it shall not be opened again until the prince is safely returned
17987 - but i caught you in the act and that was just as well for if you recall the first part of the ransom message says to follow the path of the sun
17988 - pull that speicky out thing first care that one then jigggled the do hicky and
17989 - explain
17990 - i'm not asking you anything i'm not telling you anything and uncertainly not helping you to steal anything are we care on that
17991 - clatchching at straws
17992 - please tell ozamne that his past deeds are forgiven he is free to return as the citizen of alkqaitat
17993 - that's not correct
17994 - for a second time
17995 - i am the spymaster here and it forced to me to form a plan of rescue although i may have need of you and an once i have done so
17996 - in this game you have to be prepared for anything
17997 - you re a crafty one and give you that i see how it is you became spymaster you'd make for a great thief
17998 - that's likedenly sounds like her
17999 - they well if you can tell me my daugh's p phrase i'll be more inclined to believeef your
18000 - ride the heavy weight heard what would happened to someone if they were to ste this diagant
18001 - i don't suppose you can also not tell us where the real diamond is
18002 - they cut the robe
18003 - to enough but it is still not the real cart im and if you had succeed in stealing this fake you would not have be able to findight the prince
18004 - what does it say does it help let me know if you need any help figgeturing it out
18005 - yeah well isn't ok it es what it looks like
18006 - by getting you to follow this path of the sun the kidnapper s ensure that they are delivered the real ds
18007 - well it doeses ontgo anyway
18008 - good now let's get out of here you go first
18009 - please don't leave on my account
18010 - then white tell us all of this
18011 - i am holly convinced your aim has always been to rescue prince ali and that you are only trying to steal this diamond in order to pay his ransom
18012 - i saw not dishonor myself or the ' memory by disobeying his last order
18013 - come on we've got to move fast glad the heavy weight again then let's get out of here
18014 - it's good practice for me
18015 - she pretty much orddered as here to get some aid
18016 - okay the diamonds in that compaction at the back of the ru
18017 - this is the long way osmand family when i was younger it's the reason i was vanished from alki and the reason nor gotd kicked out of the palace guard
18019 - they go
18020 - la
18021 - what i can tell you is that placing the heavy weight on the diamondds display triggers an alarm which is how i caught you before so maybe you should just keep old of it
18022 - the lookout gastrapp was a clue
18023 - is this have spies ask for help
18024 - how you look around see what you can find maybe there's something in those chests that will help
18025 - problem is i never did figure out how to get the diiaond out i think it has something to do with those head scales in the middle of the room
18026 - you would bter yourself
18027 - goodlucked you bothse
18028 - indeed and you a great agent
18029 - osman obdy long fin no see
18030 - now follow me you can tell youa little tale to the emia
18031 - funny how life works out there at least i'm here for the right reasons now
18032 - wait kacoluium that was it
18033 - so if the sccrew relates to the head scales it sounds like they all look identical but one of them is heavier than the rest it's the heavy one we need to put on the diamond pedestal
18034 - god take them away
18035 - so you thought you just ignore the en' borders and steal it
18036 - the emme was a direct man and yours were words he needed to hear
18037 - but i don't think that in the same place as they were before sorry
18038 - in light of the situation i am also ignoring your attempted theft but don't get any ideas
18039 - wait hmzanama that was it
18040 - there is no way to even find prince allee without taking the carrot ib let alone rescue him
18041 - but it loed up prghter than the business end of a camel and i should know i've had firsthhand experience
18042 - quick we have to get to a roof before
18043 - especially if or you ended up with wasse the fake
18044 - not that you'd get far
18045 - wait is it that you don't want us to steal the diamond at all oh just not the wrong diamond
18046 - the palaceis in lock down so we use the different entrance
18047 - that is amere earle now he succeed his fatherhe approved to be a strong leader for alkte
18048 - old
18049 - really because what it looks like is me catching the so-called master heief ozan who's attempting to steal the cuted inper
18050 - perhaps if his thieving skills were as good as he thinks sheat have brought the dun back with you one
18051 - like of course
18052 - your daughter was there
18053 - the real carried im
18054 - before you say anything i hold neither you nor orzan accountable for the em 's ath he has been ill for a long time
18055 - world congratulations on in order you have safely returned prince ali home
18056 - those are your orders not mine i no soldier i not even an alcuri citizen any more if you remember
18057 - okay sure so we broke him but on our way and we overheard the mere ordering you not to trade the diamond
18058 - lea please
18059 - i've handled enough precious gemstones to know that's a real diamond
18060 - and as for your part of this the city of alkhaed rewards you
18061 - yes and if you remember that's wuse situation very much like this one do you have anything to back up this little story
18062 - let's get the diamond before heading back to the roof
18063 - i did not ask him to steal the diamondds in fact i told him not too that was his choice
18064 - wait soomer roomega that was it
18065 - you're just guessing
18066 - don't just yankeit open it might be boy trap
18067 - if you've got any questions we can talk once 're out of alki for now just trust me
18068 - it looks like one of the waights from in front of this head stat ute goes there
18069 - ah it's true she would only freely give such information to an eye and only in dire circumstances
18070 - grab the heavy ight from the scales again before we head up to the roof
18071 - keep your voicedown girl was i knew what was at stake he chose his path and must take responsibility of voice actions
18072 - you where to actually you are told and return your area in drainon

18190 - isn't somewhere else you should be right now perhaps out rescuing prince ali
18191 - it's just a diamond who deer
18192 - the caradum stays here low exceptions
18193 - anyway as i said before congratulations are in order you have shown yourself to be a most efficient agent and for that you must be rewarded
18194 - there
18195 - and now i believe that even during the war the primary goal has always been to obtain the carried it
18196 - a son do something
18197 - so as things stand i'll car it must a few ozan as a traitor to be arrested upon site
18198 - and you and your quarters
18199 - welcome it is good to see you again how can i be of service friend of alren
18200 - you shouldn't have railed up your body so much
18201 - the em's word is law come let us leave him to his rest
18202 - it does not come close to covering all you have done for me and this city one day i hope to repay you in full
18204 - i believe as one wishes you to talk with the emre this is heighti unorthodox but the em wishes it too
18205 - we're not leaving until we convinced you i don't understand me how can you be so callous
18206 - i have no time for idle chat i must prepare the emmy's body for darial
18207 - good idea in fact you shouldwill go i must attend to the eme 's last rights
18208 - just like you do with your agents
18209 - well you're bring ozan or not wait for you both upstairs but please use the front door this time
18210 - osman you're stalling this situation is untenable and you know it
18211 - no
18212 - will you do this it might get dangerous
18213 - indeed i may have more work in future for someone with your ability
18214 - yes it is the most troubling aspect of all of this that the deva herself would directly intervene in such a way terrifiesly
18215 - even without myself for my son alcohoy dist roong you have my answer
18216 - be careful with your acconation spymaster the pharaoh sent me here is an envoy of peace manopas is not in the business of kidnapping
18217 - we were up against the godess a mascoutt was behind this whole thing
18218 - emer may i present our two intruuders
18219 - not missing kidnapped this was a deliberate act i wouldn 't be surprised to find out that manifeststals behind it employing politics where war has failed you
18220 - though i met ozan on my briefly i could tell that he has a good heart
18221 - at any cost emmehere even if the ransom is to be the carriedt ib
18222 - i am certain osman will have more work for a person of your caliber
18223 - please don't tell me 're carrying it on you go on and get it out of feir
18224 - i only pray prince ali will be returned to us safely please if there is anything you can do to ateid us and discuss it with os man
18225 - i feared as much
18226 - rest assured my people are looking into this
18227 - don't be absurd o an you heard yourself he was dying
18228 - that 's better i can actually breathe over here and i find the incse gets at my nose
18229 - you need a free space to accept it
18230 - and now she is behind my kidnap and the theft of the carredb i only hope that whatever she is up to can stopped in time because whatever it is it won't be good
18231 - very well perhaps some other time though i fear it is something of which only you and ozan will be capable of doing
18232 - if my son is not safely returned to succeed me many of us will declare org again i sat and bring him all at any cost
18233 - no it 's just war mongering and slavery these days isn 't it
18234 - inte it is
18235 - among other things
18236 - no you manipulated him into doing what you wanted
18237 - what are you doing here you have more important matters to deal with
18238 - though your earlier activities may have suggested otherwise you have turned out to be a true friend of alki
18239 - a son please see our guest out
18240 - i believe i have a plan to save prince ali but i can 't talk you about it here
18241 - osma is aware of this and will ensure they come to no harm
18242 - the peacece between our kingdoms is shaky at best between the emmy s illness and the princegoing missing you need to establish some stability here
18243 - it may seem harsh to you that he would evaluate above even his own son's life but i understand his reasons
18244 - let it unfair and you know it he only did what you asked of him
18245 - yes any year i will not fail you
18246 - now that they have it the gods only know what the next step will be
18247 - yeah i didn't mean for data do this
18248 - i am sorry but i am too busy with theaffairs of st to talk with you without an em guidance there is much for me to do
18249 - after i have annointed the body he will be carried out into the sun the people will want to see there anyyear one last time he then be touned below the palace
18250 - why have you brought the diamond back here if i can hear it other people will to go and rescue prince ali
18251 - it is not all good news father we lost the diamond
18252 - oh then how should i insult him
18253 - oh i shall return to drainor but not for you i have some loose ends of my own there to deal with i am done with you and your games
18254 - if as you say you wish to save my son that i beg you to do but you are not taking my
18255 - osman
18258 - after you ambassador
18259 - as a prisoner i was privly too much that my kidnapper spoke of i am convinced this is all part of some wider manified plot
18260 - how dare you
18261 - and your people had best st clear of manifas if they valu their lives
18262 - i have no doubt he will prove to be as wise and fair as emme shah was
18263 - please get ozanne and meet me back out in the vault and there's something i need you bothpos to see before you get it into your heads again to steal the cart e
18264 - i have my resance
18265 - all thousands thank you
18266 - oh but it's so much fun
18267 - well austman who was in myvvoult
18268 - very well by is one i should take it back to my pharoh
18269 - excellent my goard' s infor me that ozanne is back loitering at the foot of the palace of steps
18270 - personally i hope it doesn t have come to that in fact if you were ever to return the carried e i would welcome him a home as a brother
18271 - but it's your son
18272 - you have returned prince are to us and where he is the emme now
18273 - well i refuse to play your game any more
18274 - my
18275 - so
18276 - he has a short punue too but he is not lacking in responsibility or honor
18277 - mother my ansunwer is no ambor no manified would ever sit on al ci throne even if only ask cusalian
18279 - i am not dead jabi and even if i were leaders would rise be they of royal blood or not
18280 - indeed manifhes's pharaoh is proof of such
18281 - one other thing ozan gave me something to give to you
18282 - my father did not tell me all at the carried secrets but it did tell me enough to know it' true value to ialll re it
18283 - you would leave your city leadless
18284 - but you agreed with us us man you sit yourself it is just a diamond
18285 - of greater concern to me is that he manifites and a musket not only have the diamond but also know something of it
18286 - enough gentleman please keep your town civil in the emme's presence
18287 - thank you for bring news of the ransom to me i am forming a plan you and ozan should prepare yourselves for the desert
18288 - i shall attempt to maintain the peace as long as possible but i have assigned the osman to look to this matter father we will have answersred

21313 - oh
21317 - iyes
21326 - with there
21337 - the
21349 - like everything in life combat has a natural cycle
21350 - air spells
21351 - i know youyour kingen that wait until a demonstration to attack the skeletons
21352 - adventurer could you use a damage over time ability on me please
21353 - you plan cast magic spells without a wand or staff but your spells will be dramatically more effective when you do use one
21354 - attack with skeletons and remember to use abilities
21355 - let's start by attacking the ranged skeleton
21356 - finally we will show you how to use magic
21357 - abities such as anticipation and freedom can protect you from this but time them wisely
21358 - i can see that you're quite the veteran i wouldn' love for you to help me run some courarters
21359 - now that we've learnedt how to use basic abilities let's deal some real damage
21360 - for this session we will be demonstrating the different combat disciplines available to you
21361 - show these students how it's done attack the training dummy
21362 - finally mes warhamers all have crushing heads
21363 - excellent
21364 - abilities and have different effects they can allow you to vary the way damages dealt they can be used to debilitate your opponent and some can be used to defend yourself
21365 - great that 'll do now i hope you've seen the benefits of exploiting your enemmyies weaknesses
21366 - a stanone will not only stop your opponent from moving but it will also prevent them from performing any actions this includes eating food to heal up
21367 - arrows bolts and ththrroonewn projectiles each cause damage in different ways
21368 - ab some food change gear you need and then speak to me and will' begin
21369 - okay adventurer hit me with a comb attack
21370 - here is an example of a combo attack
21371 - your spellbert will tell you which element a spell belongs to air water earth or fire
21372 - to prove the power of abilities she will take on all of these skeletons at once and kill them all
21373 - the combat academy is a place for interpreted adventurers like yourself to improve combat skills
21374 - now attack the magic skeleton
21375 - now attack the mlay skeleton
21376 - that is what is known in the trade as the combat triangle
21377 - ah not quite
21378 - i also provide training dummies for practicing combat in a safe environment
21379 - let's stop by attacking the dummy with meay
21381 - let me know when you're ready to begin the practical demonstration
21382 - it may seem like a lot to take in but just remember
21383 - lastly magic attacks are most effective against meayara
21384 - equip the correct weapon before attacking the dummy
21385 - after using an ability you'll be unable to perform it again for a short while
21386 - greeting students and guest and welcome to my combat academy
21387 - you need to be using the shortbow
21388 - i can see that you've achieved a great deal already could you help me with some courses
21389 - needless to sa if you do get hit it's going to hurt
21390 - it's time to see all three types of abilities used together show them what you're made of adventurer
21391 - i'm afraid m going to you dismiss your friend before helping me with the course
21392 - range gets the better of magic
21393 - once we have fifty percent of remeal and we can unleage powerful attacks called thresholdabilities
21394 - now let's show the class how effective food can be
21395 - pistol crossbos and heavy crossbows use faults
21396 - today this adventurer is going to help demonstrate the basics of combat to you all
21397 - sorry but only combat academy sanction equipment can be used in the training sessions please come back with no armour equipped and a clear inventory
21398 - however they are ineffective against ranged arour
21399 - that's not right
21400 - that this demonstration my friend here will slay a lowly skeleton with his bare hands
21401 - our fellow adventurer will now prepare for the course
21403 - the best way to achieve this is to prepare so that when we need something it's at our fingertips
21404 - let's give last fellow adventure a time to grearup again then we'll start with one of my favorites the stumb
21405 - weapons such as dagers spears and shortswordss have stabbing points
21406 - we don't need anything from there yet
21407 - you cast spells to inflict damage
21408 - there are many types of ability one even makes your normal attacks stronger let's just deal with something basic to start with
21410 - our fellow adventure will now perform an ability
21411 - exploiting the specific weakness can give you an upper hand but failing that you should use one of the other damage types in the same combat discipline
21412 - remember when using magic you need to set up a spell to autocast
21413 - now we will show how all these elements have combat come together give us a moment while the adventurer gets some more food from the table
21414 - but they're ineffective against meayara
21415 - once sticks aarrows in the dummy
21416 - i am lady deathnel and adventure like yourself i've explored all the ls that galin or has to offer and now i've returned to my roots here in lumbragege to help other adventures start on their journey
21417 - sorry you need to unequip your weapons and ar and have an empty backpack before you can help me there's a pank deposit box nearby
21418 - let's start by attacking the magic skeleton
21420 - inspect the dummy and attack it appropriately
21421 - dyou go i've more to give you but you need space in your bag
21422 - first we're going to show how best to get into combat
21423 - there are three types of damage you can deal with mel weapons
21424 - okay just let me know when you're ready
21425 - now we've gain a decentamount of a journal in we can assusomea real fund
21426 - just let me know when you're ready
21427 - oh well
21428 - now let's live a typical ranged weapons
21429 - each discipline has a variety ofequipment available to it especially weapons weapons will make your more feer some opponent
21430 - make sure you've got fifty percent of renaline and use a thresholdability on the dummy
21431 - when we were in combat it's important to have everything we might need quick to hand
21432 - when you know what you're looking for you can read your opponent like a book
21433 - food is a good place to start adventurea grabs some food from the table
21434 - inspect the dummy and attack it appropriately
21435 - to start with my adventure friend will go and get a weapon from the melay equipment stand
21436 - you need to attack the ranged skeleton
21437 - see never take your over granted
21438 - and of course a specific weakness to air water earth or fire will also indicate a general weakness to all magic spells
21439 - iang you'll need to free up some room before i can give you anything
21440 - hang on you' need to free up some room before i can give you anything
21441 - ranged weaponry allows you to stay ata distance and runs circles around your enemy
21442 - as you saw the adventurer couldn't perform any actions that is because she was stunned
21443 - attack the dummy with ranged
21444 - as you can see food will help you endure longer battles
21445 - my friend here will now attack one of the skeletons a quip yourself adventurer
21446 - sorry that only combat academy sanctioned equip can be used in the training session please come back with no armor equipped and with a clear inventory
21447 - attack the skeleton and remember to demonstrate a range of different abilities
21448 - finally the different kinds of spell
21449 - we don't need any food for this demonstration check one of the equipment stands
21450 - if you remember these simple rules you can better prepare yourself a fighting different opponents
21451 - now activate momentum
21452 - the next effect i'd like to explain is damage over time
21453 - the ability momentum will use up adrenal ine instantly to increase the power of your nonability attacks until you next performmanability
21454 - okay soon our fellow adventurer will be totally surrounded by vicious skeletons
21455 - bur up there are two ways of restricting your opponent vs and stums
21456 - using basic combat abilities fills your adrenal in quicker than normal attacks do
21457 - for this session we will be identifying and exploiting our opponents weaknesses
21458 - okay time forre more practical demonstration
21459 - great this was a prime example have had to best manipulate the combat triangle learn it it will save your life
21460 - so let's build a renaline by using some basic abilities
21461 - first we're going to attack the dummy as before
21462 - sorry you don't have enoughspace in your bag for the rewards
21463 - if you perform another ability or action it will interrupt and the combo attack will end early
21464 - we don't need any more equipment for now
21465 - a good example of how to manipulate the combat triangle learn it it will save your life
21466 - we have the punch bags over to the west next to the fishing shop everyone could attack these and they can take as much punishment as you care to dish out
21467 - there you go
21468 - i hope you're not trying to steal items from the combat academy
21469 - regge grabs some food and then speak to me when you're readyto begin
21470 - yeah
21471 - let's what a renal can do
21472 - throughwr weapons are a damaged type in themselves these include knives and chavelin
21473 - anopponent who as a specific weakness to stabving slashing or crushing weapons will be almost as weakk to mallo weapons in general
21474 - you will need to inspect your enemy carefully let's look at how to do that
21475 - at first glance you may not notice what your opponents is vulnerable to
21476 - iran short courses on the most active side of adventuring more specifically combat
21477 - i run short courses on the more active side of adventuring more specifically combat
21478 - attack the dummy with magic
21479 - finally i d like to cover abilities that take more of a supporting role
21480 - to the northern the south we have trading dammy dispenses which will deploy a more advanced training dummy these will match your skcale and can attack back should you wish
21481 - the blade or head of the weapon dictates whether it is suited to stabbing slashing or crushing
21482 - com atttaacks before multiple attacks within one ability
21483 - good work
21484 - ah spells
21485 - because of this think carefully about the order in which you trigger your abilities otherwise you might later need one that you accidentally use now
21486 - these attacks are okay for taking down weak enemies but what do we want to deal some serious damage
21487 - is a rereshher of what we've just learnti'm going to call out combat disciplines in the adventurer will switch weapons to demonstrate each one
21488 - you can use some special attacks called abilities these allow us to be a bit more creative while fighting
21489 - while the damage output of abilities is great that's not the only reason to use them
21490 - a good way to keep one step ahead of your opponent is to be well supplied
21491 - you should refer to this to see the abilities you can perform and to select abilities that you may need an upcoming battles
21492 - as you fight you'll build a renaline this can be used to perform powerful attacks
21493 - there are many of these abilities but we'll just cover one for now and you can experiment with the others on our combat dumies
21494 - giveves my cellllow adventure a timeing to gear up and when he comes back to me will begin
21495 - you need to be using the airstrikes spell
21496 - understand your opponent before you rush into a fight adventurer show the students how to analyze their opponent
21497 - are you ready to begin the practical demonstration
21498 - now let's go over the two most basic rules of combat
21499 - these attacks hit multiple targets at once they center on your current target and also hit those adjacent to it
21500 - my colleague is going to attack the training dummy without using abilities when my assistant is ready to move on we'll see what can be done with full adrenalin
21501 - sorry that only combat academy sanctioned equipment can be used in the training sessions please come back when you have no armour equipped and a clear inventory
21502 - others require specific weapons such as two handed weapons or jewe wielded weapons
21503 - now let's demonstrate how to exploit the weakness your enemy shows
21504 - magic relies greatly on binding your opponent to keep them at a distance
21505 - these abilities will inflict the set amount of damage split up into multiple hits over a short period
21506 - mala has the edge against ranged
21507 - a magic user will cast air water earth and fire spells
21508 - now we shall cover ranged weaponry the damage you cause will depend on the ammunition you use
21509 - you must use a training dammy dispenso that doesn't currently have a training dammy deployed when you use them you can select a weakness and a difficulty for the dummy
21510 - now that we've shown you thresholds it's time to put out some real pain
21511 - these abilities are great they allow you to increase the amount of damage that your opponent is receiving in a set amount of time as you can continue to attack while the damage over time ability is in effect
21512 - as you saw the adventurer couldn't perform any actions that is because he was stumbbed
21513 - not a spouse
21514 - you were supposed to use normal attacks adventurer but if you feel ready to progress we will
21515 - let's show them something impressive build up your adrennal end and unleashion an ultimate ability on the dummy
21516 - these abilities don't directly deal damage instead they either boost your damage or reduce the damage you take
21517 - likewise having a strong weakness to arrows or boltts or throwing weapons makes your opponent broadly poor against ranged weapons
21518 - arranged combatants can use arrows bolts and throne weapons
21519 - this is how i expect order engage an opponent in combat
21520 - first we are just going to attack the dummy without using abilities
21521 - whilst momentum is active you don't build a jrenaline but it is a useful ability if you want to go on a more casual killing sspree
21522 - give my fellow adventurer a short while to decide what gear to use and will begin
21523 - magic
21524 - on your person you should each have a book detailing the different abilities
21525 - wow your re adventuring accomplishments rival my own i would be honored if you would help me run some courses
21526 - are you ready to begin the practical demonstration
21527 - let's start by attacking the dummy with magic
21528 - and magic is powerful against mely
21529 - attack the skeletons rememberred to show off your ability effects
21530 - here are three skeletons each representing one of three combat disciplines listen carefully as i explain a relationship each discipline has to the others
21531 - nonshowords battlewaxs and seitars have slashing blades
21532 - ranged
21533 - a bind will stop your opponent for moving
21534 - always be on your guard you never know what dirty tricks your opponent may be willing to use
21535 - there are three different disciplines meay ranged and magic
21536 - you can read about the specifics in your ability book but for now we'll go over some common effects
21537 - now we're going to cover multiple target attacks
21538 - okay now that we're prepared we can attack this dummy with an ability
21539 - go on hit it is not going to kill itself
21540 - first you need to understand that different weapons inflict different kinds of damage
21541 - i think it's time i took a hit performer stnbility on me
21542 - that wasn't right try again
21543 - however they're ineffective against magicar
21544 - practice makes perfect as they say but training dumies are no substitute for real combat experience 'm afraid
21545 - many abilities require a certain amount of skill in that particular discipline
21546 - in your travels you should expect to meet for idable opponents that do not show a weakness then any combat discipline will be equally effective
21547 - also your opponent can interrupt your conbo attack by performing a stbility on you you could interrupt an oppon's conbo attack in the same way
21548 - you need to attack the mey skeleton
21550 - the combat triangle is a very important aspect of combat learn it it will save your life
21551 - ranged attacks are most effective against magic armor
21552 - a valable
21553 - okay before we move on to some more advanced combat we need to learn an important lesson
21554 - let's take a look at what a stunb can do
21555 - to prove the power of abilities he will take on all of these skeletons at once and kill them more
21556 - shortbows and sealbows use arrows
21557 - most rangeed weapons require ammunition but that ammunition you can't hur anything
21558 - now let's examine a magic spell
21559 - in the previous session we introduced the three combat disciplines these interact with each other in an important pattern
21560 - meay
21561 - now attack the ranged skeleton
21562 - here have more arrows and put them in your quiver
21563 - normally magic spells require rs to cast much like range dammunition some weapons such as that one reduce or remove the need for rs
21564 - give my fellow adventure a short while to gear up using the armist stands behind me and will begin
21565 - you need to attack the magic skeleton
21566 - now that we know about abilities that have a more practical demonstration
21567 - attacked the dummy with me
21568 - what
21569 - flyres spells
21570 - magic works differently to meay and ranged
21571 - let's start by attacking the melay skeleton
21572 - these can be found in the constitution and defense sections of your ability book
21573 - let me know when you're ready to start
21574 - you look like you know your stuff but i could always you to hand demonstrating things to my students
21575 - i can see that you're anadventure with a hunger to explore into the unknown could you help me with some courses
21576 - rule number two to featature your opponent
21577 - for this demonstration my friend here will slay a lowly skeleton with her bare hands
21578 - ok time for the practical demonstration here up then speak to me to begin
21579 - great that'll do now i hope you've all seen the benefits of exploiting your enemmyies weaknesses
21580 - i can see that you're a seasoned adventurer could you help me with some courses
21581 - next up we're going to cover comombo attacks
21582 - excellent try another
21583 - we don't need any equipment yet
21584 - i m sorry but only combat academy sanctioned equipment can be used in the training sessions come back with no arour equipped and a clear inventory
21585 - that's not the right attack try again
21586 - mal attacks are most effective against range damma
21587 - excellent now let's hope b students have learned what weaponry is available to them
21588 - you need to be us the syitar
21589 - i'm the demonstration of this one to my fellow adventurer he's a multiple targetability on these combat dummyies
21590 - that stopped by attacking a dummy with ranged
21591 - ru number one do not die

21944 - i get you
21945 - or thou not to do so if you are squeamish perhaps your gods' will reward you
21946 - oh from
21947 - so if magical energy is stored in rooms and the sole fragments are made of matchural energy by reason that the soall fragmentsance could be storing rs
21948 - yeah
21949 - i go
21950 - i'm sorry arianne the archmaagege was clear maybe if you told me why i could pass on a message

21952 - but
21953 - ala
21954 - i know one of be intible
21955 - we f
21956 - one
21957 - earlier today as ris presented your idea to the council as her own work
21958 - you already know the adventureof spellbook for an adventure like you the best wayight will learn is to go out and practice casting spells
21959 - i'm serious we should show this to as risk she s spent years trying to crack the problem he written volumes and why it can 't be done if this is an elementary mistke she have seen it before
21960 - wo
21961 - yes specifically the secret of the teleportation spell that lets us reach it
21962 - if you must lay the organat least he to the top manual it s quietist not even archma sror could concentrate with without rreket from the loud manuals
21963 - thank you them here ll check with the really my believereason before i give you your reborder like it's in youit of accuracy
21964 - that
21965 - him
21966 - and you think that justifies this
21967 - oh
21968 - said
21969 - there 's an old human called trborn in this tower who 's always talking about strange creatures maybe you should be asking him
21970 - well i's to americ your forameric
21971 - how done
21972 - i think you might have solved the teleportation problem
21973 - i say we
21974 - the fourth question
21975 - take
21976 - who knows what's down there there could be knowledge that's beenlost for a hundred years
21977 - i am earona red he to the sacred tradition of the staff of fire i bring the vengeance of san maron and keiban whom you betrayed
21978 - sur ise
21979 - 's you
21980 - my ti poum i always tre for the diriving an aum thisis really
21981 - ohyeah
21982 - for a terriwhat spell to be useful it has to be able to bypass obstacles and that 's what the wizards of the old tower has so much trouble working out how to do that was the teleboortation problem
21983 - a dealin i knew that some of the red wiszons were demonologists but i have no idea there was a even involved in the spell that created the powerbeing
21984 - i know in the evenning to feible
21985 - but that doesn't help us with the problem we need to find out what these waterates are
21986 - so
21987 - and what we should and shouldn 't do
21988 - so
21989 - no
21990 - all i 'm saying is there have to be limit those are things mortals can do but some things should be able the gods
21991 - i hungrly
21992 - what i'am going to do who is complete your work your solution requires a second plane of existence for the travel to pass you i mean to find such a plane
21993 - one
21994 - i've just had the sole fragments of eight powerful wizards inhabiting me i near exploded and then i found out the man i most trusted had been lyined to me for the last ten years please forgive me if i'm not at my most cheerful
21995 - i 've heard about putting part of yourself into your work put the old wizards literally put part of their souls into the powerbeing
21996 - him
21997 - the old wizards would have used the same type of energy to create a powerthe something went wrong and the energy ended up imprinted with fragments of their souls
21998 - yeah
21999 - so what did you learn
22000 - al
22001 - i do
22002 - his's dead by now or will soon be the energy of the sole fragments will destroy him like they melydestroyed me hell exploredde in the abyss so that tower is safe
22003 - and now wdoving him visible
22004 - the orders worked together for seventy years but eventually the amarakian wizards betrayed the others and permed the tower down
22005 - how you are my proof singing me watch and there's tower no where can i find a cave big enough to keep you in
22007 - you can visit the room span by going through this portal next to me the wizards have been observing it from the room craft in gill four years but it's only recently that they've been exploring it
22008 - oh
22009 - this is interesting
22010 - be be that my bes and where of my beeds

22015 - they 're not posts at first i thought they might be ghost for their they 're sole fragments
22016 - very po
22017 - i'll ine it 's a disabling ward but it stops me usingmagicso you ' haveto deal with the vortex
22018 - you should talk to the other wizards as well ask if they've seen anything unusual lately one of them must have seen something that will help us
22019 - so you
22020 - s you mans
22021 - theyay stole my idea
22022 - peran found ed the second tower and blamed the first towerers destruction on red wizardskelibanwent into hiding and took an apprentice who in turn took an apprentice beginning a secret order of elite red wizards

22053 - mayit doesn 't matter
22054 - and think govern this new world may your order
22055 - this is it the heart of the old tower the central spellcasting chamber where the old wizards performed their most powerful rituals it 's amazing i never imagin i 'd seen in person
22056 - yes that was interesting thanks for helping with that
22057 - i will ask you a series of questions your answers will reveal the order to which you are best utited if you disagree with your allocation you may take the tentse again
22058 - you should start by using them on the chairs in the library
22059 - in the theory i could if i had a precise means of fixing the destination a teleport phrase for example right now i'm working on something else so
22060 - most importantly that tower guards the secret of the ruural essence which allowed human civilisation to prevail over the monsters and bararians and usred in the fifth age of the world
22061 - who call me from the inflal vestibule
22062 - you how dadyou of course i'm a wizard gop piece of chiky who are turnyer a draw rog
22063 - i am sure that demonic influence is mi the core of the ritual is still wizard as is is green magic
22064 - no her young singingme was
22065 - has that really what motivates you is life just a italally of victories for you
22066 - it seems i owe you thanks adventurer i trusted with a dela on so much that i was lyinding to his plotting beneath my nose
22067 - so you've learned to channel that energy enjoyed while you can and name moment now it'll overwhelm you
22068 - i musted i am your apprenticeit and i belong to the order of the red wizards of amaric
22069 - when i looked into it after the meeting i saw your handywork in there and traces of the problem that i set you
22070 - strength through wisdom gentlemen do either if you know what this is about
22071 - we have long known their teleportation is possible but have failed to invent a new spell that could connect the tower to the ru essence
22072 - no i did hear the commoion in the library earlier though
22073 - didn't you know that this tower was built on the ruins of an old tower
22074 - the blue wizards killed your master and drove you underground but you foundedit a secret order to seek vengeance
22075 - here on the roof i'm a little cut off from what's happening in the tower and i still hahave't been allowed inside the roomcraft and guilded
22076 - what can i do for you on this glorious day adventurer
22077 - the sole fragrments aren 't ghosts they 're like copies of the old wizards personalities taken as a particular time any wizards might survive and their selfll fragments of silbe here
22078 - may plenty you said
22079 - you 're holding sole fragments of two of the wizards who lived in the old tower
22080 - did you succeed in triggering it on the memory in the shshowine room
22081 - the green wizards worshipped gthics god of nature and balance according to the ddruids gthics created the world and then entered a deep sleep
22082 - it was a follower of gthics who discovered the ru essence and the green wizards with the old towerers's experts on roomcrafting
22083 - i'm glad you're hehere if there is something wrong i'm sure you in thesenior wizard will be able toget to the bottomof it
22084 - and elderly wizard the last practitioner of a unique branch of magic dies her diary might contain details about her unique magic but her will states that the diary should be destroyed on her death
22085 - may
22086 - after someamiraqi an majes but the tower down one hundred years ago arch ma perant decided to keep the spell secret rather than let it all into evil hands
22087 - people are never going to drop that all they
22088 - all we need to know now is how the wizards were arranged in the ritual if we could find fragments of the document the wizards wrote the ritual on we could piece together what we need
22089 - upi just
22090 - if you referring to that thing attack brarian however there was in itdidn 't it before
22091 - the surface part of the old tower was destroyed by the fire and the new tower was built on the same place for the underground levels of the old tower are still there
22092 - i believe that's why wizard alris wants to see me the roomcrafttingin guild wizards cannot disprove my theories and i think it's worrying them
22093 - volitual requires eight participants who must stand in a specific pattern please stress to your masters that the ritual must be performed exactly as described any deviation could be extremely dangerous
22094 - what can i do for your adventure
22095 - temrin the gray so you've retain some degree of consciousness
22096 - that veter you have the right tuet of air
22097 - you want
22098 - i need barked from a hollow tree and some fine cloth unfortunately both of these can only be found in muritania and the cloth is only found in the tomb of shades
22099 - i felt tral i must insist the you step away from that organ
22100 - there are other gods besidide saradomian gthics and zamarac the gray wizards were those who worshipped less than known gods such as armadil or the meaph amium or were nonreligious
22101 - thank you i must admakeit we of lost if tradeborn hadn't helped have no idea what he summoned because it's certainly teriffied the wise old man and that woman
22102 - and what we should and shouldn 't do
22103 - sh then it was nice chatting fieldel
22104 - worked in secret for hundred years self important proition of the magic st y no requard
22105 - it was wasn't this to discovered the ru mysteries the secret of creating rs out of ruin essence arch ma edror will tell leport adventureures to the essence mine his offices on the second floor
22106 - my history of ginoff i have almost reached the dawn of the second age
22107 - perion have the hypogan installed in the librarary and he wrote a treatise on the relationship between magic and music
22108 - wease don 't do that it 's a very distracting
22109 - you were right to come to me i have experience dealing with that sort of magical coma so i should be able to bring around
22110 - you are balance between two orders a final question which are these do you value most
22111 - oh o is see then it looks like i'll finally see my split-bok ar marine action
22112 - it was close but i managed to restore the enjcharantments the vortteres are trapped in the ruins again
22113 - something modernday wiisards have never understood though is how the connection to the abes was made in the lastfirst place
22114 - just the usual stream of visitors adventure student traders no one unusual why do you
22115 - i know but while we're down there we can at least look around
22116 - the things floating around this room a solel fragments it looks like the wizards of the first hourwer that fragments of their souls into the powerbeing
22117 - the red wizards focused on destructive spells especially ones involving fire they invented most of the battle spells that made their way into today's standard spellbook there are other gods besidide sarad man gthicsx and amera the gray wizards were those who worships less than known gods such as armille or the meefh amian or were non religious the gray wizards didn't invent many spells that they made some of the greatest contributions to pure magical theory their stat sawld symbolizes the sharp minds cutting into the heart of a matter
22118 - the key to the own tower
22119 - if i condo that then the red wizards will take some credit for the ritual even if thanks to you it is not the full credit we deserve
22120 - okay he it there will i examine it
22121 - i am the wizard eon grand master of the order of sadumin initiate into the inner circle of the rin mysteries air to the secret tradition of the staff of fire
22122 - it 's worth it with this power we could build a perfect world and disease and war
22123 - yes i know but should you feel something
22124 - and think govern this new world may your order
22125 - welli'm sorry i the natural dis i just team here to unravel to mis ri of the universe
22126 - yes it's a way to take the energy out of the world aroundus and place it into ru essence which in turn makes rooms
22127 - adventurer i want to go away and think about this but thanks for your help i hope we can work together again in future
22128 - have you managed to trigger a memory one of the studies
22129 - earlier today as risk presented your idea to the council as her own work
22130 - i love of this you a vent get me out of here i ar ventur
22131 - indeed and there is more work to be done we should all study this properly and then reconvene i will be in my study with my appltice strength through chaos my fellow wiisdards
22132 - go now think about how you can redeem yourself in seil 's eyes i need privacy for my meditation
22133 - people talk about wizards having a gift for magic but the first thing you're told when youjoin the wizd's towers that it's not true
22134 - i can 't believe you have to knock down a statute to get us across that gap well it 's done so we might as well use it just be careful not to damage the statute further maybe it can be repared one day
22135 - i'm studying elemental battle spells i'm not a violent person but after you had to kill those cultures to rescue me it made me realize i have to be able to defend myself
22136 - the terport fells in the standard belbert useer plane called be abyss it 's dangerous and chaotic but that s not only me a problem because you're only there a split second
22137 - please don't do that adventurer the isenic vergesis in a critical stage and it is essential that all participants be able to concentrate
22138 - so doj i most of the spells we use today were invented in this room wizards of all full orders corporated for the sake of magical research
22139 - teleort spells need to move the traveller through a second plane of existence in order to bpass obstacles
22140 - well i can't expect to you to appreciate it as we've already established that you have no soul
22141 - besides the tower true riches were in the form of knowledge nothing a treasure ansz would be interested in
22142 - that 's a statue of eratton of the green who negotiated the treaties with local rulers that led the wizard transport rooms from the essence mine you can 't just push a statute down
22143 - break my concentration once more and you will feel the roth of the grand arch mage of the rebos hour
22144 - never mind
22145 - i don't care what some other as i don't want to destroy any power
22146 - this is interesting but it doesn 't tell us what we need could you look for more document fragments in the rooms
22147 - ah
22148 - i m a wizard obviously i work on portals and teleportation
22149 - i d rather you didn 't no one s meant know we re down here rememberthat
22150 - that 's true but that doesn t prove anything any of the old wizs could have been chanted with book against the can
22151 - i know one of zoron's impossible problems i ' meant to try to solve it to low and why it can 't be solved
22152 - let me see
22153 - to be abyss the sole fragments of the old wizards made him tell whatort there
22154 - have you spoken cededrador an eron
22155 - the ritual would have opened a permanent connection between this plane and the one zron found te leboort spells could then use that connection to travel anywhere in the world including to the room essence
22156 - when i took aranne on as my apprentice she asked me to help her suppress her premonitions she didn't want to stand out because of a natural gift she wanted to stand out if at all by the work she put in
22157 - well no but be careful ok try not to damage the statue
22158 - what
22159 - you don't remem me i suppose you must rescue lots of girls from evil cultice i can't expect you remember of the all
22160 - this is split bar armor is special arour for majors is much more resistant to physical attacks than robes
22161 - i think how we releas if you can disrupt sortce of the power
22162 - it 's starting to win you over isn't it i don 't think anyone can stand here and not be inspired
22163 - so you will have master of the ods of magicanand prayer you interest man
22164 - come on my message can waitless see what's happening
22165 - i think with a grazy ags impps have been moving my notes surround i can't find a section that what i've been working on a move big yesterday
22166 - what's that
22167 - so what did you see
22168 - one wonders what it is the generations of arch majors have wanted to keep lcked away down there forbidding a source of knowledge goes against the principles upon which the first tower was founded
22169 - we will see what was ard e says isuppose
22170 - if you use the rooms containing the sole fragments of the foremasters in front of the statues of their orders i think you should be able to trger a memory
22171 - i am air to the saccret tradition of the staff of fire the blue wizards betray you but we have worked in secret for one hundred years to bring them down
22172 - the orders were associated with different elements bru wizards with water green with her redwood fire and aggreree with air if you examine the statues you should be able to see those elements
22173 - it doesn't matter whose idea it was we must complete the vitual for
22174 - the red master was hit by the full force of the power being no one did that start the firethat
22175 - avoc salaar pto
22176 - that 's it using the information in these fragments you should be able to work out lright each of the wizard stood driventhe ritual
22177 - to some glcendo
22178 - you so thing we want at last what they look like
22179 - it's a divination spell that reveals basic information about ongoing magical effects and a wr taght it to me when i first joined the tower
22180 - by satom the holy arch ma beg spirits of the abyss
22181 - this is that vengeance hold on to that body in a moment now you destroy the tower enemies of the order must taste the flames of our rath
22182 - yes most
22183 - every time it's destroyed that reappears on the same spot so we built a containment water around it and left it there
22184 - what that can 't be right showly the wizs of the old tower above such petiness
22185 - please require inventional my assistance that i are casting an isenic birge and we must have silence in order to concentrate
22186 - so you've got the old foall his deeds think you'll never do you
22187 - the memory sting i want to see this
22188 - the law nature f chao and cosmic rooms contained the sole fragments of the masters of the four orders you 'll meet toplace each roon in front of the statute representing that mthst' dis order
22189 - did i sum it do you mean certainly not although i am the only wizard in this tower with the expertise to garden study it
22190 - the blue order of the old tower for they had any contact with demons though i don 't imagine the blue master wouldhavebeen pleased if she found out the red master had summon the demon
22191 - you should search the ruins see if you can find any parts of the ritual document the theseiees are likely to be in the studies in the library
22192 - we said dianne was our most promising student she could have be heart made somday i overlooked her dallaantine offers an adventurer everyone's reckless in their youth
22193 - i don't remember now weren't you listening either
22194 - i wish we could spend more time exploring the ruins if i can i 'll stay down here after we 've done what we came for
22195 - canwe all have to examine our constferenances
22196 - all i have is deceived i will need each of your helalth in developing it into a ritual no one of our orders can do this alone
22197 - after the first hour was destroyed it was the surviving blue wizards who rebuilt it the new tower is still a saraddinist institution although these days a lot of wizards only pay lip service to the religion
22198 - the chairs were probably marked in the cood of the four orders you 'll needet use the air rude on the great chair and the following in on the red chir you 'll to ase both rooms before you see in
22199 - please the ritual must be performeding exactly as written sovent to your justino more than coal
22200 - use the fire roomon on a red vtex and the air room on a gry one if i 'm write don 't see something happen
22201 - the stronghglolds in the northwest of the continent long way away you should visit or there some time to foods great and the companies delight for
22202 - on its own it was useless because the wizardsondidn t have access to a second plane that they could travel through that's what zon was looking for when he talked to the demon
22203 - svente your disfeener ina sexions
22204 - their statute to pick their founder transmuting a lump of ruin essence into a stack of rooms
22205 - the first question
22206 - good idea it's not going to beeasy though archmaj peran sealed the lower levels when he built the second tower
22207 - ah they are the relic of a sad tractor in the towererss history
22208 - i must have this cars the spell i can 't seem to move i think i ve stuck in the powery
22209 - yes i believe it would it solves both the distance and line of effect problems by rooutoting the movements through a second plane of course we will need to find an appropriate plain to use
22210 - you 're also need to place down the chaosroom which contains the red master i don 't think you have achair in the library so you'll have to putll it on the table
22211 - good idea but i stillwant to hear what cedruador an eroron have to say could you go back inside and talk to them
22212 - welcom adventurer for the world renow wizard's tower how can i help you
22213 - also i think wizard his gog is looking for an adventure at to help him with somethinghe' on the first floor if you want to ask him what the matter is
22214 - no if you live a circle we can't contain it it
22215 - oh this is about arieianne's morning isn't it no i haven't seen anything unusual the arch maj is dealing with the problem but if you want to go inside and pes every wizard in the tower then i can't stop you
22216 - quickly wi's we must finish this fell at once
22217 - that's whattime guessive not yes he comes
22218 - i thought the wizards of the ontower when noble seekers after the deep truroops of the universe first welearned about their bitering and academic politics and now this
22219 - okay let 's see
22220 - i cannot tellim part in this ritual comparion
22221 - it looks like we weren 't the first people to come down hereafter all
22222 - i think there was an enchancements keeping the waterortes here but someone has removed it now they're able to go up the beam to the new tower and you saw the trouble they can cause
22223 - play shared a jman to holy arch man i going to to your p
22224 - impressive no we wizards love to invent titles for ourselves all it really means is that i'm one of the senior wizards of the tower
22225 - ing what where were
22226 - is that all we think about you have no soul do you realize that no soul
22227 - the blue wizards believed magic could be used to help people and focused on noncombat spells they invented most of the encharantment spells in the standarded spell but we use today
22228 - indeed i did the title is normally reserve for the head of the wizard's tower but in light of your mastery of both magic and rulecrafting i believe you have earned the right to use it
22229 - the old woisard's ritual created a linked to the abyss which tellport fells could then use that 's what the powerofvam is all our teleport fells use the powerbeing as an anchor
22230 - that's what i'd like to find out they were a powerful wizard and they knew what they were doing this was a calculated attempts to damage the wizard's tower
22231 - if this is real there was a plot to destroy the oldunt tower from the inside
22232 - cededredid will be preparing to cast his isicenic purge i needed to go back to the new tower and delay him until i further restored the encharancement
22233 - i other deal for you to consider mortal giveave me a single robber of your bloder and i will tell you the secrets of the magical arts
22234 - very well then here you'll go
22235 - the old towels made up of wizards from all over the world with wildly different philosophies of magic
22236 - the blue wizards worship saradomen god of goodness and order he 's the most widely worship god in human lands
22237 - i can 't tell but it happened recently within the last few days
22238 - lo
22239 - you can buy wicked robes from me the hood will give you rooms and ru essence and even tell port you to the roomcrafting alars the rest of the robes will improve the hood and make you lighter
22240 - a adrum get me out of here
22241 - the purge is complete thank youu fellow with itsself what eneries' entities were they could not have survived such a powerful wave of magic
22242 - it save perion i study the ritual it uses demonit power but it 's safe
22243 - but being a sier runs in families it's not something i worked for when i told the other wizardzs about it there resented me
22244 - actually i 've already got an idea about how you could do that if we were to recreate the ritual that created the power being that would disrupt it and release me
22245 - please let her know that i take her seriously even if no one else does i will do everything i can to convince arch maor sitridor to take action
22246 - it 's looking more and more like it wasdestroyed by in fighting between the different orders we won't no forsure anceunt we create the ritual there
22247 - i am nearing the end of a long line of our cane research and i just need to consult a final a few books in the library soon in this room will be the site of a break throughu that will change the tower fore
22248 - the leaders of the four orders used the shring-room to hold meetters that 's the re upstairs with the statues representing the four orders
22249 - all i 'm saying is there have to be limit those are things mortals can do but some things should belevel the gods
22250 - i'm studying stun and buying spells if i get into a fight again i want to be able to disabable enemies without killing them like youed with those ctists
22251 - i think i m clo to finding out what happened here i need to work on the sunmy own for a moment
22252 - a senior wizard asked you to take part in a ritual that will greatly benefit the tower before the ritual starts you discover that he learned part of it for a demon the ritual of his safe but demons are expert ions
22253 - creating humanmen
22254 - and you decide what gets left to godss paren your order
22255 - and what if it 's not an elementary mistake
22256 - use the firireing on a red vortex and the airline on a grain one
22257 - silence slow water you no longer interest me
22258 - for every room we make we must bring essence here from the mine through iic wilderness and across pirate tested seas wizards of all our orders have lost their lives bring the rooms that our eans
22259 - no wait you're an inventurer on to you will you help me
22260 - she has an announcement
22261 - and it did work for a time the first hour stood for seventy years and it wizards invented most of the cells we used today
22262 - on need you to attrtive ortex into this circle and keep it there will i examine it
22263 - he is thank you adventurer i will inform the arch majorimmediately
22264 - this is amazing we may be the first people to come down here for one hundred years
22265 - i told her that that was admirable but it would be wrong to turn down an advantage the guards had given her i helped her too harness her gift to refine it and do samarak with what the other wizard's thought
22266 - the rule essence lies in the frozen north where the eye of sanadomin once rested the first wizards reached it by an arduous landhoood but eventually they discovered a spell to tell it off their directly
22267 - what do you mean
22268 - i can replace the enrancement that was keeping the vortes here but it 'll take some time why i do it you need to go back to the new tower and delay federals's casting at his isenic purge
22269 - it was a sort of swerry you sparkly see
22270 - this tower is built on the ruins of an older one which burned down a hundred years ago the story is that zamarakiian wizards betrayed the other orders but the details of what happened to a mystery
22271 - the third question
22272 - oh did i slip up did i let on that i know more than i should almost as if i planned this whole sequence of events and my plan is so close to completion that i've becoming careless about what i say
22273 - i ' about half done he there
22274 - she's a born greay wizard clever but naiveve i just had to give her an interesting hook and she'd go wherever her curiosity led her
22275 - but i prevent for this eventge didn 't i i asked you to be here in gcase something went wrong it looks like that fouright has paid off
22276 - so if you want to help
22277 - i don't recall saying anything of the sort if you did want to read that book though for its historical interest perhaps you could find it on one of the bookshells on the ground floor
22278 - canwe all have to examine our constances
22279 - the bpstore all sorts of things most of things i don't really care about like the eggs both of w and don thinkthings like that
22280 - don 't worry your actmade uor is very capable feel almost the sa as if i were back at the nknown stronghold
22281 - thank you just go to archma cededradoran
22282 - green magic
22283 - behold the vengeance of the betrayed soules of the great old tower behold the bloody foundation of a new tower rising to destroy it
22284 - i heard that a strange magical force had entered the tower and attacked the librarian but that's all i know
22285 - you'd better watch your back when you least expect ed i'll be there you should we go sticking your nose into other peopless affairs medler
22286 - oh however can i do anything for you
22287 - adventurer i suggest to leave the library and find your friend aranne tell her not to worry we have dealt with the problem without any help
22288 - and i can i help you
22289 - i help if gray segment would leave me in peace
22290 - i see things in there thing i me watchs no one else se them they think i' mad
22291 - then why did you take your idea to asthis of the green order rather than coming to me
22292 - who are too modest as risk the gods may inspireus but the work is our own
22293 - well thanks again
22294 - every recently er was t calledt penix discovered an alternative rcrafting method speak to him on the roof if you're interested
22295 - you don't remember mei suppose you must rescueyou lots of girls from evil cultists i can't expect you to remember them moreall
22296 - but there are seven more it s all i can do to keep them contain i lllet them speak through me one by one
22297 - i can also recolor these ropes for you and provide you within this steam icon for them to show off how much you've trained energy cycling
22298 - my fellow wizers this document contains that the oretical framework that will allow us to create new teleport spells
22299 - you need to read the fragments and work out how the wizards were arranged then put the rounds on the for of this room to triatgerto the memory
22300 - go zmmer of
22301 - when i looked into it after the meeting i saw your handlework in there and polices of the problem that i set you
22302 - i ' read about it but i never thought i 'd see it the greatest magical innovators have given or once walked to this room
22303 - even so what you've shownus here is a major breakthrough the deser's recognition whose work is this
22304 - the isenic purge floods that tower with energy but these wateres are attracted to magic all little do is draw them up into the tower and make it impossible to get rid of them
22305 - archmaj cededuador head of the towerso you should talk to him i think wizard elloron might help as well he was my mental while i was there
22306 - two of the ritual participants survived the destruction of the first tower perry end the blue and kellean the red
22307 - of course i'd happily tellll you sama if you bring me those items
22308 - it is my own after a lifetime of searching gotthic soffit to grant me the necessary inspiration
22309 - i do know it happens just after the wizards discovered the inner secret of the room mysteries the r essence teleport spell perhaps that discovery led to a conflict
22310 - well true something kids figure away from me
22311 - welcome blue wizard
22312 - we can commcomence as soon as we readready in i will see you in the spell casting chamber
22313 - go now think about how you can redeem yourself in zala's eyes i need privacy for my meditation
22314 - i am going to head back down to the ruins to study the vortices i want to find out what happened to the old tower and who released the vortes from the ruinsmay me down there if you want to help
22315 - he's the only tower wizard who was sympathetic he convinced me to work on them rather than suppress them
22316 - magic and music that ' hard combination i don 't think anyone s written a book on both of them since
22317 - it took the wizard of the old tower decades to crack the teleportation problem it wasn 't solved until shortly before the old tower sdestruction
22318 - indeed i have completed the ritual that as rest the green presented to the council i have made a copy for each of you to take to your master
22319 - i told you it wasn't like that i knew what i was doing
22320 - that 's it
22321 - it was horrible it felt like it radiated evil power
22322 - yes i 'm not hurt and i don'tthink i 'm immediate danger just can 't move
22323 - i tried to use my magic to understand and control my ability my goal was to integrate it into magical theory so i could teach it to other wizard but i ended up being expelled from the tower
22324 - yes i've i am making good progress
22325 - yes i talked to the cage demon in the wiiszards tower and i ught me that you can' trusteevens but that doesn 't mean you can 't ever learn from them you just need to be careful
22326 - never only zamara grants has the creativity to have truly original ideas
22327 - i don 't know i 'm sure you can think of something if he 's casting a my scenic purge who'll probably bein the library on the ground floor
22328 - no i can see i think behind was zamron it's a money
22329 - i'm sorry myel but but midit came to nothing anyway as we said the idea was a blind alley
22330 - i'm shaken but i'll recover if you han't been here though i i couldn't have contained that energy for much longer
22331 - you can 't damage it past combat spells on it lead into the beam
22332 - that 's the fundamental principle on which towwersi meric is based by manipulating roomines we combineding the different types ofenergy to create magical effects
22333 - as risists this is amazing if this is true
22334 - a letter pity i thought they were winding me up
22335 - these vices look like the one that attacked was a born i want to find out what they are
22336 - youll there stop that speaking for the demon is strictly for bridden
22337 - there's a rumor that the door can be opened using the water surge spell that many wasn't have tried casting that spell on the door and failed it's more likely that there's a key hidden somewhere in the tower
22338 - who are youevenven reason
22339 - stop talking i 'm trying to concentrate
22340 - hey you can explore once we finish dealing with these waterortes
22341 - originally the wiiszards of the tower were not as unified as they now are there were orders devoted to different gods notably sanadomin goardand goodness and order and samara got of evil and chaos
22342 - master what 's going on
22343 - sh up sl no one even remembers you
22344 - that s all of them you should be able to use those rrooms to trigger the rest of the memoreries
22345 - arch-page srator is aware of the problem perhaps you should ask him what he's doing about it
22346 - the last major discovery the old tower ma was the inner secret of the room mysteriess the teleport spell to the ruin essence i don't know for sure but i'd guess that somehow led to the tower being burnt down
22347 - how many times have i told you that we do not trust the other orders
22348 - there is a iriian magical orders who resent that to was monopoly on the room mysteries the zamarakiian magical institute the don high maybe more we don't even know about
22349 - each of the fourmasters had a private study but i think some of them have collapsed you 'll need to find an intact want to work out which marger it belong to
22350 - i suppose i must have done i was barely more than a child when i joined for tower and wizard elevon told me about its history i used sidadroom about the old tower witheards of all faith working together
22351 - i told them if you s very previ from the ritual and now what's happened just someboded soul fragments possessing something sint of a go
22352 - we're threeree but i think i can see a more fitting host for us than these rooms don 't you
22353 - that's not funny
22354 - athen
22355 - in my case a cosmic room should make a suitable receptible youit will need to tipe your action so that the room being used matches the color in the psychoic from the
22356 - most of the cells in the standard fellbook d back to the old tower combat spells were mostly created by redwoizzers in chart spells by blue wizards so forth
22357 - strength through chaos fellowwizards it's good to hear her healthy argument coming from the library
22358 - may and you so both the green and the gray ordder saw your idea before i did
22359 - i wish i was surprised i had always hoped i know this a rational but i hadalways hoped it would turn out to be a appealing magical accident that destroyed the older wizards tower
22360 - with this power we could end hunger and disease and war you unlike the world my conscience will be fine with that
22361 - this tower became great precisely because the four orders are in conflict with one another we of all the orders should remember that
22362 - was
22363 - have you learnt anything from the wizard in the tower
22364 - thank you that
22365 - the ru b is theplan in which a room crarting gill was built it'sa chaotic place with ruin energy farring around on down to anything
22366 - you 're bypassing em effect anging the spell through a secondary playe using rins of law and it 'snot a completesolution that the principle is do you know what you 've got here
22367 - caradans's breakthrough the one you saw him make in the first memory provided them means to travel around an obstacle by briefly entering a different plane of existence a different universe if you like
22368 - i believe wizard eoron is downstairs talking to wizard valina in the tower entrance
22369 - i guess we' to find way across here
22370 - this must be the chamber of shrines the senior wizards used it as a meeting room and wizards joining the tower would polge allegiance to one of the four orders here
22371 - please concentrate perion saaranti morudo cmentor
22372 - ok moving something with magic is symbol mlikekehawhen i helped you move the statute of aritona it took a lot of rroomins an effort because of the statute mass but it was a simple principle
22373 - darustle i can sell you a ru essence pouch that is much bigger than any would find elsewhere this pouch will not degrade as quickly as other pouches but once it has degraded it will turn to dust
22374 - welcome to the topowerwer archma how can i help you
22375 - well it explains my theory that the roomcrafting altars are not everlasting they are vast stores for ric energy but one day they will run out
22376 - where ' zangeron 's not like him to be late
22377 - please remember once the ritual begins we must all keep our places in the circle if anyone leaves there could be disastrous consequences
22378 - cariavban who 's a prentice areyou and to which order to you ve be long
22379 - but in order to do that we're need to lear about the ritual i think watching the memories of the old wizers will give us the information we need
22380 - only wizard miss g's beanss telling a hole over the flow i should send my in to hide them before seven trips over them
22381 - why don't you go and bother with a trilard instead that our defffin is always seeing things
22382 - no one except arch mage sedy dodoorors allowed to know the secret of entry to the ruins naturally i've heard the rumors
22383 - well can you see anything
22384 - but he wonnt any threat to me he'll flee when he sees my power
22385 - when it's ready my impatient friend you note that
22386 - but i don't know any details ican 't prove anything i came here to investigate and now i find i can't get into the building
22387 - the venture can be out here before iad any more high right brain prident
22388 - torin would it work
22389 - so can you get me out
22390 - teavan who's apprentice areyou and to which order do you belong
22391 - then she lltake it to the council and you my friend will have a major school of magic named after you
22392 - and you saw what color it was read the col of of salaq it was red wizards who burned down the tower one hundred years ago this could be another zamaracque and brought to destroy us you've got to do something
22393 - oh all right
22394 - to stand their adventurer do something
22395 - who are you and why should i care
22396 - did it work have you managed to trigger rememory
22397 - no coloron they took your idea they took it when you handit it to them
22398 - it work thank you
22399 - i think i 'm close to finding out what happened here i could chouse your help again ifyou 're interested
22400 - once you've done that you should put the room for the master of that order on the master's chairand the werein for that ordder apprentice on the chair facing it
22401 - magic isn't handed down by gods or random chance anyone can learnit if they put in the effort
22402 - you ll need to read the fact s and work out how the wizards were arranged and put the rrooms onthe floor of this room to trigger the memory
22403 - oh hereyes there's nothing to worry about magical comass rarely last long you'll see her up on her feet very soon
22404 - strength through chaos on a fred i have no idea i suppose you were in the middle of something that
22405 - i'm a sia i have premonions sometimes flashes of information emotional impressions nothing precise latelyi've been having visions of the tower in flames
22406 - the tower is the finest institute of magical learning in mster in asania or candin the standard adventureous elbook and the teleportation loadstones are both products of tower wiisards research
22407 - i 've prepared res to hold the other six solel fragments you 'll need to use each room on a vortex of the appropriate color
22408 - we have no idea i suspect as risis is keeping us waiting in order to inject some dramine to her announcement
22409 - there are schools of magic besides that ourwer standard spellbook i used for forbidden source of information when i was trying to understand my premonitions
22410 - lina the toers and danger i need to speak to arch maor cededrador
22411 - what i'm going to do who is complete your work your solution requires a second plane of existence for the travel to pass through i mean to find such a plane
22412 - plankss adventure talk to me again outside the tower if you still want to help
22413 - could you go back into the tower and find the key i think was ard elloron will help us if we tell him what we're doing you should start by talking to him
22414 - hey what are you doing
22415 - this parbe so teadvan's idea would i still think agreeen with it would have come up with an ention
22416 - but the stomamatic beeds there was a red one again i one of a black oneder a vo one
22417 - oh yes sorry
22418 - if i cansu that then the red wizards will take some credit for the ritual even if thanks to you it is not the full credit we deserve
22419 - even so what you've shown as here is a major breakthrough the deser's recognition whose work is this
22420 - i hope it handangs over your head for the rest of your earlier spuring you on to greatest perhaps then zamalac will make something of you
22421 - welcome green wizard
22422 - i wasve faly used it sincese training but it occurred to me that it might tell me who removed the enchancement from the paling
22423 - the entran is on the east side of the islands come on
22424 - you have a brilliant and chaotic mind collaan the ven as this has worked on the same problem for so wrong that her mind has turned to stoone and her apprentice hasn't had an original thought of his life
22425 - can 't be done as can prve you ' to have line of effect
22426 - we it should have been mymind have worked on my life on this problem and then some kid has the idea it should have m
22427 - adventure it 's good to see you again
22428 - we no too late there's something happening
22429 - adventurer i think i think someone wants to talk to you
22430 - is actually very easy for me to make for i've been evvenan trouble getting hold of the pieces
22431 - how you're doing but i findighting my but the beef
22432 - and vent your the ina mor ancho
22433 - i can also provide you with staves made of ruin essence these are ineffective as mal weapons but they can store the charge for spells which only cost rs and are good at defending against magical attacks
22434 - who are too modested as risistk the gods's may inspireus but the work is our own
22435 - maybe you could but i 'm not risking it we need to find a safe way for us to both get across
22436 - he wouldn't have mentioned it if it wouldn't help us you should t be able to find it in one of the bookshes on the ground floor of the tower
22437 - oh no i' i'd better make sure my emergency escape teleport spell works
22438 - i can't explain listen if the archmaage cant me perhaps i could speak to wizard on
22439 - they go enjoy your new almor
22440 - welcome gray wizard
22441 - you 'll need to put the four elemental rrooms and the chairs of the corresponding colors water goes on blue earth on green fire on red and air on gray
22442 - they've atattackched the towewer before but it's always been more direct this is the first time they've come close to doing real damage
22443 - the second question
22444 - that must be what the red master wanted from deemon the pey of this would have beenthe last thing they needed to create the powerby
22445 - i can restore the enchancements that kept the vortes in theruins but i need to do it while they're still here
22446 - i'mreally done
22447 - well it 's full of knownes how much noiccircle if they
22448 - i'm sorryian you are bred from entering the towerer for any reason
22449 - acquiet in the library please
22450 - oh we heard rums he was planning something don't worry my top wizard and iye will be ready for him
22451 - welcome to the wizard's tower adventurer
22452 - yeah we won and nothing else matters
22453 - master
22454 - we are prepared
22455 - with hindsight it shouldn't have surprised may when saidedror expelled her just for using every source of knowledge at her disposal
22456 - don't hry you won't have to contain that powerful long the sole fragments will tear you art and the explosion will level the tower
22457 - you can tell arieionne that her concerns have been noted i'm preparing for deal with the anomalies in the power beam so there's no course for concern
22458 - it's still a theory and most of the crafting gill wizards think it can never be done but wizard elristhings that the roomspan might help my studies
22459 - oh i don 't think so let 'ssee where is tellibrortta and known teers
22460 - it's too late for that adventurer i have no quarrel with you leave now or be caught up in the tower's destruction
22461 - i heard that commoottion in the library earlier i assumed it was wizard borren jump in its shadows again i'm not sure he's cut out for the year stressful life of an academic librarian
22462 - master
22463 - ruins of pieces of ruined essence that have been inviewed with magical energy different types of room different types of energy
22464 - of course that makes a lot of sense
22465 - ohhel made then let be explode with a fury of zararch with my death that tower will fall
22466 - i am preparing an isenic purge it will send a surge of energy through the power beam which should overpower whatever preachers have managed to enter it
22467 - everything about this tower is unusual from my point of view the human approach to magic is undlessressly fascinating
22468 - i can see that there is some evidence that she has premonutions but unless she can give me a s specific information say really nothing i can do
22469 - acjustina cow menal
22470 - i've seen them in the power being you know asing me what
22471 - and we saw the ritual used to create the powerv i need to write that down the before i for get it it could open up from new lines of alternative teleportation research
22472 - as ris is this true
22473 - that could have been the start of the breakthrough that liapened to creating the powering i think we 're on the right track
22474 - it seems this situation is unstable adventure i recommend draw each personality fragment out of the whose's body before it is overwhelmedming
22475 - wasn't gray sg next d decided you didn't likely for some reason so you he invested army of ps
22476 - that 's a good idea i hope you find something interesting
22477 - we've already might be perning put to ade the tower i am sure hred or would we thinkig of somebody to stop him
22478 - balances car my fellow wizard i'm sure you're wondering why i gathered you here
22479 - i just hope it's well preserved it would be terrible for knowledge to be lost forever
22480 - my your appprintt is you are fulfilling the purpose for which i trange you your wide eyed search for truth has led you exactly where i wanted
22481 - invisible thing in me what's in the toweler a i'll give an eyeout for them
22482 - such a hitity samel would try to destroy it pouring out adventurer you was the last room
22483 - to whom did you ask me to talk wizard earon my old mentor his room is on the second floor of the tower
22484 - maybe he 's
22485 - oh ok i have a good timeand watchs out for sheep they more cunning than they look
22486 - hello again adventurer what can i do for you
22487 - you have a brilliant and chaotic mind kelaan the red asthis has worked on the same problem for so long that her mind has turned toesstow and had apptice hasn 't had an original thought in his life
22488 - it 's all aboutout power arem looking at ways to make the spills bypass defenses
22489 - of course it matters i was there when taliban lad break through this at his work
22490 - you will be all over the kingd of the by now you kill any too fine and collect any the bes that they drop and need a big one of them back here one and then pask one and a wife one
22491 - how many times have i told you that we do not trust the other orders
22492 - i found some things in the ruins you might be interested in their yours if you want them
22493 - then you'will be pleased to know that you will soon be able to act out your moal dilemers for real
22494 - this is one time i'll let you use demor acknowledge and around
22495 - we will cast the spell for anyone we think trustworthy but the spell itself is an in a mystery of the tower and is taught only to select individuals
22496 - i think that's it we found out he released the vortuese and we stopped him that's what we set out to do
22497 - through the library floor but that means it was something from the old tower
22498 - after he completed the ritual the red master would have needed to distributeit to the other orders i would guess that he did that by meeting before apprenices in the library
22499 - what i want to do is recreate the ritual that the old wasn't used to create a b i think that will release me
22500 - you knew tomor powerwers never safe we re the stoff
22501 - what am i going to do about as less's taking your idea nothing you miss your chance to have your name attached to this
22502 - see if you can trigger another mey in the library i think you 'll need all for apprenices and the red master
22503 - i'm sorry just aram i'm a formertell wizard i'm an adventureinl they stoout of the champions skilled
22504 - hey wife the keyto the ruins is in the water surge spell after all would if you're not meant to cast the spell that insteadedulleents to play its rinss as a sequence of notes
22505 - maybe one of the orders wants to keep the room mysteries to themselves
22506 - solving the deilportation problem changed everything it let the was ard create the loanstone network and the ru essence wboorts ilmthat the towers have to rely a delicate landrooutot to get rs
22507 - thank you for saving me from that thing please to keep my mind spike as a reward
22508 - i passed my prentichip i'm a z now
22509 - there i think i get this adventure you need to wait for the right node then use an earth room
22510 - it 's not normally used on afeffects this powerful though which is w like you hear
22511 - i thought your order perfected a attx spell's decadees ago isn 't surge the theoretical maximum
22512 - after the meeting in the shshowyingroom the masters would have gone to their studies to talk to theirapptices can you try to trigger another a memory there
22513 - aranne is a brilliant maagege but she has never masked the subtlees of human interaction the oath ice swo the tower prevents me from helping you
22514 - willels born mind spike so let 's air rike from your spellboot and then attacks vortex
22515 - you should run away now adventure you don't want to be here when my apprentice loes control of that power
22516 - no wait i recognize you your the adventures then you mentioned will you help me again
22517 - so the taller still stands and i may be traptiy of another hundred years i can wait return when you have half mastered magican prayer and you may even interest me
22518 - that's what i cant workout i 't see what's wrong with my solution
22519 - it's been years since the arwer was rebuilt i think the first archge maage was a little eccentric in his architectureural and preferences
22520 - as thanks for saving guatar i have given new access to my personal r ess ence store take as much essence as you want from the chest in this room
22521 - no dont don't make me tellle whatt
22522 - did i i'm sorry it's a bad habit i picked up somewhere
22523 - you know what she did don't you
22524 - that's what i want to find out i know the tower is in danger but i don't know the details
22525 - you 've completed the spellmaster
22526 - arch maj pion you built this tower buil it on the bodies of the red order no will play a part in its destruction
22527 - who the obbears my fellow resisard
22528 - thanks for your helpalth adventurer i couldn't have done this without you
22529 - the thing that attacked was at borren came up the power being from the ruins i don 't want to risk touching it until we 'veinvestigated
22530 - what i can't allow a deammomon worship are in the tower the towel has had strict rules against iracian wizards for the last hundred years and i have to apply that even to her
22531 - we were talking about what we could do once we have the ru essence teport spell
22532 - salon in keiban were my friends and you are nothing like them you would eat pollittle marions or for
22533 - it is a y i not observe this phenomenonfor an external advantage board how will
22534 - i wish we have more time to explore these ruins properly
22535 - come on open the door let's see what'sin the ruins
22536 - but master i'm doing this for you
22537 - amazing i wish i could s it
22538 - you 've already done more than enough adventure you can leave this to me now a magical coma is a delic condition so you should leave it to an expert
22539 - no s where the trialthere n't it if it doesn t work you can true something else
22540 - you are behind in your studies due to illness and a test is coming up your place at the tower is safe but if you fail you will use some respect another apprentice offers you an opportunity to cheat
22541 - it s not a simpllas that each teleport spell goes to one specific location creating a new one can take years of research
22542 - we re hurting someone i conssent it if you have a way to get me out of please using
22543 - what no not seeing me what 's still be particulous they wouldn't fit
22544 - my idea is that if you put these in places in the tower where these wizards once were you can treggerthe memories of what happened
22545 - luckily i believe i found an alternative method of making rooms ruic energy cyphening in the rs span
22546 - before the rise of our current civilization the other goords went toawardwith one another for control of the world after millennia of fighting gthics awoke and banish them so they could no longer intervened directly
22547 - the cover
22548 - strength through wisdom gentlemen do either if you know what this is about
22549 - oh no rightke of menn strongold i ing centhere king nan o to learn about human magics
22550 - they ve tesky thingaway what they get everywhere they leave a terrible yes too
22551 - you have become a senior wizard and are asked to take on an apprentice the boy is talented but undisciplined and does not apply himself outside his areas of interest what is your approach
22552 - and air even senior tower wizards aren't allowed into the ruins i certainly couldn't tell the secret to a disgraced ex-wizard and an outsider however much i might prvately want to help you
22553 - you that sto that speaking to the demon is stick bidden
22554 - arrival wizard is threading lies about you and has made you the lauving stock of the nearby village they believe you are of low intelligence and poor moral character and through a vegetles veion when you visit what do you do
22555 - nos i'm all it does t matter if i have known this entire rualol was based on red magic i would never have agreeed to take part
22556 - do you know what this is i think this is what destroyed the first tower
22557 - we will come back when you have them all i've lost a white be peated of that be and a generby go kilsome es
22558 - she was my apprentice and she has done exactly what i talkedght her
22559 - no coloran they took your idea they took it when you handle to them
22560 - that's nice it's been a long time since i thing we watch came to see me
22561 - it's been longer than 't rememb i dare say some foolish wizards summed it while meddling with forces they did not fully understand
22562 - wizard you have proved yourself worthy all that remains is to deter ine the order to which you will belong are you ready to be tested
22563 - you're a singing me what i shall see what of cu ward said i was mad
22564 - i vent he said you begin me out of the ap jew it fories
22565 - not now i'm trying to concentrate on a very difficult spell
22566 - leaveher alone
22567 - i spoke to the demon spoke to it but there's no middleground with cedrador step outside the line and your red isit
22568 - then why did you take your idea to azor of the green order rather than coming to me
22569 - he's gone i can't believe he was using like that he mentled me for ten years how could i not have seen it
22570 - then the ong may knowledge ideidea do you know what this is about
22571 - no wait i remember you you helped me with pattrollal shaven and heavily we helpped me again
22572 - this tower became great pre precisely because the four orders are in conflict with one another we of all the orders should remember that
22573 - as a corakx keeper of the key to the abyss hearing by the staff of aradil on which someone ac canpiled the empty lord i charge you to appear
22574 - the greay wizards didn 't invent many spells that they made some of the greatest contributions to pure magical theory their states s symbolizes a sharp mind cutting into the heart of a matter
22575 - honestly my idea it hadn 't occurred to us to ask
22576 - i'm sure there'has been something strange happening with the power being lately the beam actors and anchor for all our teleportation spells so as a teleportation specialist i am sensitive to any fluctuations
22577 - straight through chaos master you wanted to see me
22585 - and so say did cl
22588 - that things

23716 - turns out it was a ceasing are called quin ceassingers have the power to control the oceans and those that live in it through song
23717 - i record they show up most stdays you do have much in common similar skills or one thing they won't be able to stay away
23718 - that woman had some powerful magic she might even have been an aoccultist
23719 - i reckon he's a criminal
23720 - but they need to be close a somehow quinn had found a way to control the monsters all at once from afar
23721 - and you urheard what she said didn't you
23722 - i haven't been a man of faith for some time but there's a higher power to play here whatever the flavor of your faith saladomen the faith flying seea godds' someone is telling you something
23723 - and your backstori es all overlap hub you paid the death notice to kill quin am i right
23724 - thank you for hearing me out i know you're all busy people
23725 - well they came back with stories of huge sea monsters hydrants huge flying turtles whes the size of islands that at only men's skulls the beasts are started targeting ships as if they were instructive
23726 - and not interested in your contraband felix please leave before i am formed the porkmaster
23727 - and
23728 - i' excellent well that's the first chip set
23729 - but i will certainly focus my energies there
23730 - we should talk when you're less busy
23731 - i have a keen interest in documenting the forgotten scrolls they are essentially blueprints for powerful sets of armor ancient scrinuals and even recipes
23732 - are you a friend of the portmaster i don't think everyone mentenioned you
23733 - i settled for exploring some of the waters around mostly harmless but that's where i discovered my terrible ceasess
23734 - i see well it's about time someone took this place in hand i've written numerous complaints but the only thing that ledred do was john taking down the complaint box
23735 - and goodgoodbye tor master
23736 - unfortunately the sea monsters that were terrorizing the east until very recently made finding a vessel that would take me very difficult
23737 - just consider me a tool portmaster
23738 - and
23739 - i also collect information to provide you with summaries of what's going on in the aisles that way you can make prudent decisions on where to send your ships
23740 - if you've got business here you'llneed to speak to john strum he's probably pottering around doing nothing constructive
23741 - according to the chart she's due to pass through the jade straits
23742 - a few buckets a viommit into our journey and they brought me back to shore
23743 - she's heading directly for new heritage the biggest city in the eastern ns
23744 - we've mapped the path of chumour first where we found hub then the bay of echoes
23745 - as the port's navigator it is my job to chart the wano isles as you explore them
23746 - your ship has returned port master
23747 - how exactly one makes these artifacts has been all that lost the only record is on the forgotten scrolls
23748 - then you showed up i know i'm not a leader of men like you but the factthat under your command men are exploring the east and that i'm a part of it well that's all i could hope for
23749 - i'm at your disposal
23750 - are we finally get some resources and you wasteted on your watering hole that should have gone on the office we need to be able to manage multiple ships
23751 - that's the only member of the team who n't spend all day in the bar i've been doing a bit of prep workingin case of this eventuality
23752 - as you explore more islands you can instruct me to focus on specific regions and i'll try and find voyages for you there
23753 - and hab and i have been working together
23754 - it's almost like someone didn't want them found
23756 - and who may you be
23757 - and go and speak with john
23758 - from what i gathered these scrolls are in pieces and were scattered across the breadth of the wshano isles a long time ago
23759 - and portmaster there's a lot we need to discuss
23760 - certainly i've got a record of the forgotten scros we found and the one we're searching for here one moment pd master
23761 - i'd heard that this port did a good trade with the east twenty odd years ago so i came here to see if the owner had any old maps i could study
23762 - let me know which scroll we should track down i'll make sure i document what we discover
23763 - about time
23764 - the ship will return in its own time you should let john rumno
23765 - ah i've told you before sula i don't drink
23766 - were in thatad shape we only have one ship that sea worthy and barely any crew john kept on wal captain thank gthicss although from what i can tell he s a drunk
23767 - well there's an island not far from here called twilight the most western of all the wshano isles theres meant to be aalready supply of amo there
23768 - ah ah we received this via koourier
23769 - excellent portmaster with the upgraded office we can now run two ships at once
23770 - and apologies for bothering you
23771 - what region would you like me to focus my efforts on port plaster i can't promise i'll only bring you information from there to do so would be to close our minds and ears to opportunities
23772 - i propose we send out a ship with what crew we have and collect as much bamboo as we can hopefully it'll be enough to fix up this office and run another ship
23773 - and then she was near the crabing village plotting those points she's heading in a straight line
23774 - well i can't pretend to understand but i'll defer to your judgment portmaster
23775 - let's going to move on showing
23776 - here are the details porort master
23777 - there's not much to tell port master i came from verack originally i've got a keen interestingin cartography and was eager to explore the w shanko aisles
23778 - a pleasure as always
23779 - and self-righteousness is a rop to being punched on the no
23780 - life is good i'm a carn which grants me pow and status and i can get my more subversive kicks from working with you
23781 - anyway i'm passing the pen toml as something he wants to say see you soonme
23782 - unbelievable well we better good going you will go down in sea or legend port master
23783 - i'm good iand just keeping my ear to the ground hoping to hear of a safe place where i can lie no
23784 - and now her fathers after me the old whyine never approved and to his mind i may what have pushed his daughter
23785 - only one reason that it make it a good one how about a letter i've drafted to the white nights it might mention how you've killed several of them
23786 - not the best of news i should have just cut out his intestines and sold them to the souit says
23787 - i was trying to find a place to lie low in the east following some and pleasantless
23788 - the only problem is the mereneis it seems the tub job is using the lost men
23789 - what do you think i've always been proud of the viety pick pocketing a noblel black mailing and archbishop oh inimpersonating a reg' p that's a favorite was lu going to get that one
23790 - absolutely a place called huui ho will race called to seea orphans their orders refin as i'am used too but there'are an intelligent bunch
23791 - now that's not true you are always going to save them
23792 - not you should come to hugees sometime board master attend our parties what's the orphans practice their swork see how strong they're getting then decide whethera tub job and i cut from the same cloth
23793 - i would never let them get hurt we have a lot in common they have adopted my style of dress while i enjoy their company
23794 - i'm not want to accuse besides the damag is done he won't stop until i'm dangling from a galallows like a bble
23795 - i got involved in a relationship that ended badly suffice it to say that i accepted her gifts and she took it personally when i moved on
23796 - i've heard some disappointing news the man chasing me knows where i am now i'm not want to a portion blame but that information can only have come from this port
23797 - i can conduct an investigation but it takes a certain amount of manpower
23798 - even with beanss chemicals and tomlins attributes we are going to be hard pressed to win the fight against the pureists and co
23799 - i've been thinking deeply on a plan to help the sea orphans
23800 - oh dearo dear sticks and stones may break my bones but pray who is protecting the bones of those helpless sea orphans
23801 - no i d to work with l it's always nice to have an assin looking in the rafter just in case something goes wrong
23802 - i am in your debt and it does sound like a welcomeed diversion
23803 - believe it or not i did care for her when i heard she'd thrown herself from a top of fealador castle i wept
23804 - b job cannot be permitted to sell organs to su if we expose what's going on disgrace him then we can let his people depose him
23805 - i steal little and often from the obscenely and the money is spent on indulging in their lifestyle i enjoy the perks of high society
23806 - apart from the occasional portrait opportunity in the old signing of legal documents i le rather stress free life
23807 - se orphans are disappearing in the night killed or kidnapped but i suspect the latter
23808 - absolutely and his people were rather ther unimpressed
23809 - oh life is various weet my advis is a practically running huge
23810 - well between the three of us we've made an enemy of every villain the side of monitania
23811 - perhaps i'll have one later
23812 - at your service portmaster
23813 - i find them outside my shack most mornings i've even taghta fuel to fight with fencing swords
23814 - he was long gone when the mo brereached his homenodoubt he slink for went out of the way island searching for peasants to worship him he'll spend the rest of his life hoping to attain former gllawordis
23815 - i know we've had our differences what with all that black maile lying but i won't hold it against you
23816 - next time we meet so i'd like to talk about this problem i have a proposal that could benefit both of us
23817 - and i can complete the set a row group of sou sails are planning to raay the island
23818 - oh i am i am and i have been losing sleep over it but how can i possibly protect them i have no fleet no men
23819 - thanks sadomman of dear it seems tomin is rubbing off on me a well saidg whoever for our little escapades
23820 - and as we thought the three factions are working together the souair are on the purest chip and the pirates are circling in schooners
23821 - my name is not horratio waxen wing that's an alias something i used when i lived among the elite my real names more modest it markcus fine
23822 - and you're not the only one to think so hugees's counsel met with the seaorphans and asked for the mission to talk to me they want me as car of the island
23823 - you know what i wouldn't have believeved you if you'd said i'd become a leader and there is a chance a very good one that my pursuers wonn't believe it either
23824 - ready for a character assination
23825 - we'll have to find the claim mistress somewhere in the bowl she's an expert of a loser magic then we move on to part two of the plan getting the evidence to the council of kns
23826 - i'll be starting a kitar pretty exciting her
23827 - the orphans have been practicing with swords offencing style which should work well against the charge and slash from the pirates
23828 - yes hughi has a real carn called a tub job he lives in a town on the other end of the island and he never visits the seaorphans but the money leads back to him as the saying goes
23829 - i meant tubjob the cn of hufui i've got proof that he's a kidnaping murderrerous billraf
23830 - che still the rain has to come to an end either one does the time will one runs away so here one is running away
23831 - while that may not concern you i'm afraid i took some precautions
23832 - overall on the run from something the lives that you and i live can't be so different
23833 - i'd rather i didn't have to be here but something has forced my hands
23834 - a meaning that i've sent him a letter i've warned him that i am carn of hugei island under that the sea awphans of my army i told him to stair away unless he wants a fight
23835 - i also said that i never hurt anyone that's not entirely true
23836 - their the most expensive mercen is in the eastern lands feared fighters who tattoo their skins with maps of the ushano aisles and afraid that a hat a funny voice and a nekatchie of n' quite cut it
23837 - if you could find someone light on their feet clever and fast i'd consider working with them
23838 - so a missionerary a conflicts in a biologist walk into a port
23839 - a dash of charm of sprinkle of sympathy
23840 - ah he fantastic job i've got the money back at the long haul
23841 - i wouldn'tadmit to the others but im not vced ugee could survive such an attack
23842 - no this is how i get a message across

23844 - with still friends i'm useful to you
23845 - well do you want me to do this job or not
23846 - that's so very honorable but it's also naive remember i've spent time with the lost men people will die and not all of them will be merine ofs
23847 - i'm almost nervous
23848 - and then there's the first rule of being a calm attacka cal and you invoke the wrath of the other counts i have diplomatic immunity
23849 - otherwise all this excess and decadence would get a trifflle boring
23850 - my skills oh it must be a deviious job it must be very deious
23851 - oh too sha i would normally have a withering come back but i'm tired unlet you have this one
23852 - what we are suspected thesephans are being kidnapped the culprits appear to be meren is working with a silent partner
23853 - feels nice to write without black mailing you we've reached a new stage in our relationship
23854 - well this is the last place i want to be back in the west ah it's you may i be of assistance
23855 - i'll disguise myself as a mercenally and get a board their ship once i can prove tub jobs been buying slaves and selling their organs 'llinform thek' councsel
23856 - well we should talk more about it later i need a drink absolutely parched
23857 - don't worry port master under my leadership the sea orphans will be able to protect themselves
23858 - oh good good everything is going just swimmingly in huj we drink dy du
23859 - the sooth says would never accept live specimens so he's the one handling the money and cutting the organs from his victims
23860 - don't look at me like that
23861 - if you still want to jail me well you should look at yourself you're allegend in theving circles wouldn't capturing me be hypocritical
23862 - oh please don't take my black mailing to heart let's put this white night prisoninessis be behind us there deare now that's all that matters
23863 - anyway i should admit something i li to you
23864 - the purest joining forces with the piroates and suussays why that's a potent force
23865 - i believe he's acting as a middle man between the mercener is andasooth says
23866 - no i don't think i have anything to say to you
23867 - the towns eminently burnnable wooden palisades wooden shaacks plusidly several or eight beaches where the enemy could landamb
23868 - just mining moan business of an in in micel when these mercen is turned up i g them the slip but as you see there were more persistence than i imagined
23869 - good dayateat you
23870 - it's gi me a chance to pass on some of the things i value manals poise and thvery
23871 - by the means i know best subterfu
23872 - best of all they don't be grudge a new beginning their eskcope like me on the run from the pureists who take exception to them being mutants
23873 - good-bye port master
23874 - i thought it was susays practitioners of old magic they need intestions for their dividinations
23875 - de ar port master i've made a home for myself for hugei the seaoftenphan seemed to be intrigued by me tugging at my clothes and asking questions about lioule in the west
23876 - i want to send a message to the souit says if they're using body organs they need to find out where it came from tub job 'fid the only personers doing this
23877 - the enemy fleet is getting close tolin says he can smell them bless him i think is excited
23878 - but the first step is getting there are you willing to aid my passage to fugee
23879 - indeed i have the awphans have been bring me the resources of the island sulphur charcole shell piecesthat when the sea oftenphans bring them to me they are careful to keep them separate
23880 - i can scarcely forgive myself for doing so we must discuss it at length soon when we're bothth less busy
23881 - i knew that their car is responsible for the kidnappings but how to prove it how can i expose him
23882 - and the missionary ruins the jke
23883 - oh i wouldn't too such a thing i'm car now and my responsibility is to the island it must have been from you know before
23884 - i know there are enemies but i just admire their plan
23885 - combinine the resources are combustible very explosive
23886 - the sea orphans are rather wonderful i only come here to nurse my hanggoververs
23887 - the white nights may have been off duty but it's the sort of thing they take a offfence at the letters postmarked for delivery in two days time if i'm not there to stop it it gets posted
23888 - sincerea regards marcus
23889 - didto even you tomlin
23890 - pirates take the island purestists killly orphans and souses claim the organs here i can see how that deal might work
23891 - from what i have heard your possibly a better seeie than eye
23892 - that all three roomum as a true i'm afraid so
23893 - well i normally work alone but that assin who drops in from time to time would certainly compment my skill sets
23894 - i am car antti sh send me to the council of cs i should really be going anyway it's being held on flowtsh

23900 - i can see why that had be tempting mostly for the reward but my crimes have never hurt anyone
23901 - a i can't believe it you have to hand it to the seaorphans their quick learners
23902 - the souoth says or dutto arrive in hugeg we need to get to the sealoften captive soon before they re gutted
23903 - re using the touch to give their own sermon
23904 - our lives are all that to similar we are both devote followers of the gods although i'm not sure we follow the same one
23905 - careit knew where he was getting from me i'm our whole is soldier of saraddomin i make people respect and fear saraddom
23906 - that's not how it was but the time i thought that a bruce was sccan price for an eternity of salvation
23907 - we should both hope that i'm no sl with a mace
23908 - this must be how saradorman felt thousands of lost souls to be ged by his light
23909 - so the gdous purureists are throphing of the mouth furious that these abominations have deemed to survive they're gathering a fleet in a sa islands
23910 - i've been waiting for the opportunity behaving now this church these people that mine this will be my starting flock

23917 - i suppose i could work with that paired l of black magic zo i think she's called i do not an mistake this for acceptance of that which is ways she's still a heretic and still deserving of sadorin's wrath
23918 - i'm here to talk with a poor master asked nor you
23919 - but their biggest threat as their pureists they see the auphans as affront newutants to be waapped out
23920 - let's just say he helped the decision along he's given funding to the seaoffens so they can bring had a dom into other islands
23921 - afternoon portmaster i've got a fever to ask brother janard is due to arrived to thee to inspct the island to see how the chouch is going

23926 - today made the light of satadoman guide you

23928 - i'm fine with iti'm more at homeing botle and in the pulpit let's time exceptafter that
23929 - i would ask for a ship to defend the island but that won't ut the tide we have to use our heads instead of our fistss
23930 - those emmorakians think they finished me off they think the offans are well and truly turned against me but even when the rivers flew away from saradomin they cannot deny their saouruce
23931 - arenot entirely but they re not like you to be causing trouble anytime soon when the weight rain comes the fleet of our enemies will be sunk
23932 - and the enemies of sanadomen gathered in the shadows but sadomens's light exposed their schemes and they suffered a great and terrible vengeance
23933 - person a cultester f quin this denner vice who i could work with while we aren't natural allies she does have an appreciation for high magic she could be of use in my endeavors

24248 - what
24249 - be all around by keeh
24250 - i'm here to reportter the poor master get lo
24251 - this pt reminds me of hanto
24252 - however it does make one rather happy to take the horn from queen while i d love to look after it i think it's safer with you
24253 - while the souussayers were sacrifice a go chicken or fish they wouldn't dare stoop to killing talking thinking creatures that the work of those very unslavvery occists
24254 - typical it seems i have company must go queen's body ard this court is here and i don't think he's a fan of the whole in the world idea
24255 - she made me immortal oh and may me kill people
24256 - i am yours for eternity
24257 - so next on my rather anunappetiszing shopping list is the beard may i be honest and straightforward with you this is the part of the ritual that i have been looking forward to least
24258 - another drink how delightful but i mustn't i simply shouldn't
24259 - no i didn't want then to torture me i wanted them to kill me and they did a rathera poor job of it
24260 - the brain is first we'll find it at the centre of a living island ced by floating eyes the eyes act as the brain sensory system i believe darling would you help me covera little brain
24261 - rightfully happy now that queennis dead i truly am free i'll miss her of course but it's a small prze for an eternity of beices
24262 - ohi certainly i simply can't await
24263 - oh we're doing the what we're up to next thing well there are a few eligible bhelors here as long as i can fit in some dinidates feel free to keep sending me on missions
24264 - it's no surprise he wanted to die we were right to let him choose how that happened
24265 - your plan was a lovely diversion my dear birted faith
24266 - as much as i'd love to talk to you i'm waiting for someone else
24267 - don't tell me that queen lives i cut out her heart and put it on a stick
24268 - poor darialling couldn t one of oco you'd be surprised what i can achieve with a lone neck line
24269 - but he's happy to work with me how any lightened come on handsome let's be off you don't mind walking in front do you
24270 - the ritual was a damp squb darling
24271 - i'll be sure to swoon sufficiently it is love l to be fought over
24272 - i also suppose i could learn with my part in all this is
24273 - lovely to see you darling what can i do for you
24274 - yes the foll wallowing in his hobris has ssent an invite to quin even if she doesn't attend queen will send lackys to collect me and the souussayers will no doubt to send forces
24275 - so i picked myself up said deutorrosho who was visiting queen and made him promiseed to get me out an exchange from marage
24276 - you've certainly given me a new lease of life unless queny is her pretty little head again
24277 - anyway darling enough of the digression the blood shall we
24278 - alas the su says now want to put me to death but won't do the much good of course but i'm sure they'll find ways to inconvenience me
24279 - so i found eternal life more by accident than anything else i sacrifed the family of seammonsters and twisted their intestines about each other in a spiral
24280 - yes yes it's very good old man
24281 - well that might seem swiftly resolved i am also immortal
24282 - still we were wondrously successful onto the body it should be easier to get hold of than the brain but life is aeli so well ordered
24283 - so here it is goodgoodbye darling is been an absolute polasure
24284 - try out splendidly sharp looking acts over there would you be so good as to hang me just drow a great big broader on me
24285 - well i'm dreadfully pleased that we got the brain of course we should start searching for the body soon when i can maser up the energy
24286 - as the spirit leaves them they full to the bottom of the sea and form the reef smaller fish than eat from the reef it's the great circle of life as tyresome ecolleges will no doubt tell you
24287 - now i have a rather unique proposition i want to die
24288 - i focus the ritual on myself and miracle of miracles nothing could damage me i even through myself of a moveved to test it
24289 - there hadn't been an occtiist in the eastern land for decades we were once numerous until the kans got paranoid that the oculties might use up them
24290 - and thank you it's the first time i've uttered those words you should be proud
24291 - darling you look at delicious read as usual i just want to pick you up deep you in honey and iblel on you
24292 - but queen wasn't always obsessed with immortality that was the result of an assination attempt and she hasn't given up on the ideas since i run away hence the body garden al being on now while following us
24293 - your men stealing to recover the body brain and blood he's plwelllowing them as wedding is styling and then you can save your damsel
24294 - by the way you should look after that horn we took from quen i sense it is truly powerful
24295 - nothing happ point and that was very much the problem the ritual wasn't strong enough i shouldn't be surprised it was only ever designed to remove the power from a southsayer
24296 - i was the one put in charudge of that pet project she gave me everything i needed to research eternal life sacrificial subjects all toes oiled man'slaves
24297 - we should talk very soon darling when you're less busy
24298 - the problem is sentimental i'm afraid the blood comes from cop' mos which grows on the graves of sacrifficed creatures it means travellling to a looft data
24299 - as i fell from the tower i had t iifany no one should get these powers who would be able to stop a person like that who would be able to stop quen
24300 - and so i must admit something darling i'm not actually standing here with you i'm leagus away at the place called the whole in the world what you see in front of you is a projection a simple fell really
24301 - oh immortality has ard advantages but it makes one something of a target
24302 - i'm handy enough with a concealed knife but killing them all would take several lifetimes no pun intended
24303 - whatever this is could we get it over with quickly my bath getting cold
24304 - i am already desperate to speak with you again
24305 - as he smuggled me out on his leisure barge i kept a pin in my closet ready to pick a lock and escape the swollen pig he's got two hundred wives already i'd hoped it forget me
24306 - they're all following me after my gift trouble is i'm not the kind of lady to freely dish out immortality certainly not to evil tyrants as the say goes i d rather die
24307 - i'm always eager to work closely with others but i need someone with knowledge of old magic for us to come together as one
24308 - still i'm tired what do you say i have a nap and we reconven later to not about the bladad
24309 - well are to a cover ver popppy yes i suppose there might be not that it have been tried on someone as powerful as me of course
24310 - i've been delighted to team up with tomlwin having a big grrough man of god around would suddenly live and things up
24311 - i left on a ship several hours ago don't worry i paid for my own i wouldn't want to danger one of your vessels
24312 - oh it sls more marvellous than it is the warriorors name is thiscord he's the official body guard of quin my previous employer
24313 - anyway i must rest perhaps we could meet later to discuss my death it would rather make my day
24314 - delightful coinins immortal body guard is the one who gets to kill her there's a whiff of irony to it it tickles the tastebuds
24315 - oh get away from me or a reppulsive little man
24316 - but there's no harm in trying i have nothing better to do since death is of the carts the ritual requires three things the brain the body and the blood
24317 - tyrants want immortality for themselves su sales of all people want to silence you permanently common everyday problems i'm sure you'll find
24318 - oh i always have someone chasing me mercinenary south say a ceasing as conns i seem to collect pursuous
24319 - it was oroshoe the old pervert he took the blood body and brain from me and de manded that i travel back to his island falling dawson
24320 - good now i'm going for the well deserved bath with that image only leave you and hopefully we can talk more in the future
24321 - a blood ritual here fighting demons there oh it can be so dary
24322 - it is a delight and a pleasure to be in your presence i am zuso delyus to meet you again
24323 - but i try the ritual on myself in my chamber it failed it simply wasn't potent enough to take my powers
24324 - well i've clapped eyes on the ravishing hunk of a clareric a missionary i believe he's often here nursing a pint and smoouldering away in the corner
24325 - anyway darling i have a ritual to complete next time you see me should be eminently killable
24326 - we have been their ranks a little haven't we you most persuas ive as convincing as a si but the less blue and obsessed with your hair
24327 - qu this ceing a god wind of me and demanded my freedom she took me into her employee calling me her ocalist she gave me the reit to sacrifice anything see monsterss demons even humans
24328 - earanyway we will be wanting to steal a portion of it shouldn't be much of a trial the seam moners will be on their last legs tentles and assaulted other appendages
24329 - i grew up there sweety it brings back memories the su says taught me within its walls but my abilities were prodigious they didn't know how to deal with me and my power soon outstreet de
24330 - i don't know much about your gods and their magic but with our knowledge puoled tomlin and i would be unstoppable
24331 - quin is a ceasinga the most powerful the eastern lines has ever seen and she is fascinated by eternal life she wants to live foreever as is the want of nose tyrants i suppose
24332 - i must say i didn't expect to be ched all the way to the west but i can't blame them for trying
24333 - on a waste of time of course but a girl has to try
24334 - could you marchine a simple life a life where one isn't chased by n worlds while attempting rituals sounds dreadfully dull doesn't it
24335 - fd enough we stay vigilant for the moment i warn you though at the slightest hint of incarceration i am throwing myself down the deepest well i can find
24336 - we must talk made me in the bar later i can't await
24337 - filthy are imaginative peasants i was the one who had to give them the ideas that s certainly weren't going to produce any on their own
24338 - good greaty sty could you not
24339 - it was your idea after all and i would repair you handsomely
24340 - shall we get started darling
24341 - for now we should arrest i'll return later with another delicious affair for us both
24342 - anyway it seems that allosu and i have a little date i'll ouw der my nose shopen my concealed knife and i'll meet with you later sweiting
24343 - i do hope it's me get bigick last and you' probably doing something terrible
24344 - i'm so glad that a certainting girl link made peace with kal's family
24345 - needless to say we should probably avoid quinn and this cordt in the future they've been a yeapping like talks at my backag for some time now and they won't let up
24346 - it's not that it's difficult to harrowing on no it will be the quickest of the tasks
24347 - but first shall we continue ouvveils the second element of the ritual is the body we'll find it at the keening reef where sea monsters go to die
24348 - get away from the court
24349 - what a height so many proud man beickakering over who has me no i know how the needy princess is from your fairy taless field
24350 - it has all the ingredients of as sum to as far with me as the pretty shining cherry on top they whipped themselves into a frenszy and you take advantage of the chaos the lices
24351 - oh i'm just thinking about death about you and aboutve the delicious smell of onion soup that hangs around this place
24352 - ecstatic to see you again darling
24353 - which i could the wait but this is the only solution
24354 - well i simply can't await for my date with aurorshoe the old per i ve sent him a letter so now we just have to wait
24355 - he's a caldarling and he wants the fulfilment of an old promise he wants me to marry him
24356 - they took exception to that as many weaker individuals do they kept me isolated and fed me very little i was given may flies and mosquitoes to sacrifice but nothing bigger
24357 - if you're lucky i might even decide to stay alive and hangg around for a while
24358 - but don't play coy i've heard youyour not stranger to the arcaine arts yourself your knowledge of ruins is second to none
24359 - oh attempt to throw yourself intoan eternal pit and everyone tries to save you it's indeing but ever of frustrating
24360 - i'm glad we were the ones to do it the ones to kill her who a deaf way of all things it's your unpredictability that i've come to love
24361 - i understand your plan now darling you're taking advantage of my knowledge and my inability to be harmed by traps
24362 - proutds stupid or rou
24363 - killed the one person who s still hunting me sure i'm in
24364 - any who say that' got out of line well they got a ritual there was a talkque of giving it to me at one point why keep me when you can neutralize me
24365 - withinthen again who can forget a woman like me
24366 - i was desperate at the time i was working for quin just after she had turned paranoid and chan'ide all you know when she was demanding the secret of eternal life
24367 - i hoped quinn would redeem herself we were very close once i mean before she tandled crazy and everything
24368 - a little anxious wasst time desperate to perform the ritual it will change everything let you know as soon as it's done
24369 - brain matter is so cloying remind me to pack a per issue next time we steal somebrain
24370 - i send on ou a letter promising a wedding today but only if he made it a big occasion i'd expect nothing less i said a parade in the streets a festival in my name and i wanted him to invite all the cons and ceasing us
24371 - i ve come to the whole in the world so that i can throw myself into it it's a little overdramatic i know but it answers the problem don't you think
24372 - so the cn gathered their tidance and hunted them down
24373 - after i failed to kure quinn the car of the sea i barely returned to the death lots with my life i did not know what to expect i knew baby tools our leader would be furious
24374 - little can i have something you will want to hear
24375 - i drove a group of slovers called the skullls out of woshankle maybe you have heard of them they come from around here
24376 - pretty and fam but i could not have got his far without you you have provided shelter a ship crewmen and wisdom when i needed it most
24377 - sounds like isand of doing will the work them very well let us do it
24378 - he told me that i had brought shame on the desath lotus and that the order of assin will be lucky to survive queens's rus i was to leave the order i accepted this with reluctance
24379 - if i promise not to kill him would you take me there this a can
24380 - it is the way of the assin fail at to a task and your life is forfeit he failed to take my hand so i took his head
24381 - i would rather not be hiding in heavens but ever since that des lo ass in spotted me i have had to keep a low profile
24382 - while the wo shank have never been peaceful quin brought colnage and all outwar between sea and land
24383 - you see much little can carout tells me that back is at the fiireberb in on the cimerra isles
24384 - hereroundus everything i always duty had something of the suit say abouthim this is purest betrayal
24385 - these people up been taken to moreitania vampires will judge the slavers they will look hungr at the slaves and pay for shiploads more
24386 - before we get too deep into celebration a few things should be mentioned
24387 - yes slavors iss not enough that your western is take goods from moshanco you must take the people also
24388 - i will i should have explained myself at the time i disrespected his family by running away

24390 - then many things but i will leave you eager to hear more back awards me and that is information that i'am keen to extract forcibly from his foul height
24391 - no the game has been one the deatht lots will acknowledge this and return to the other games in play it's how they've always weacked

24393 - i haven't talked to k' cruth since i killed kira i'm not sure that want to see me

24395 - crawl off your dogs before i cut off their ears
24396 - not too different from yours i imagine we are both skills killers are not
24397 - no i studied him in the heart and varied him according to his customs
24398 - i didn't bring them here they are they were mercenaries from the wousshanor i friends of a group of western slavors
24399 - and john trum died on the field
24400 - we see killing as a game and i lost is how it works
24401 - proud as i am i know i cannot attack without a ship or a crew
24402 - i am not one to remove limbs as you can see it doesn't stop a person from killing
24403 - he knows his people are easy pickings he used the skull so that his hand remains clean then he took a lion share of profits to fund his green palace
24404 - i visited ka he was sat cross leg in his chambers he knew why i was there but didn't move

24407 - he had to quen threatened to level car'svageif he did not set a trap for me she threatened to kill his family friends and kwmen

24409 - she killed my friends
24410 - oh it's like watching your parents fl
24411 - qu the ceasinger is another matter she may yet abandon her search for me that partles me hopes not he is the one who got away and i would jump at an excuse to kill
24412 - we do not have long before he moves again this is our only chance litter canan this will stop the death lo is assance from chassing me
24413 - he had to die of course i could have stowed away on one of your ships but i thought itapped to ask first
